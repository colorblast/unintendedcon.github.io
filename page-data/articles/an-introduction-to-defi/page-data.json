Maybe you're here because your aunt phoned you up and asked you whether buying bitcoin was a good idea. Or maybe it's because your younger brother / aspirational youtuber has just embarassed you by making more than your paycheck off some bullshit dog coin. Whatever your reason is, welcome.</p>\n<p>Defi stands for decentralized finance. It serves to copy the existing functionalities of existing traditional financial products and add additional financial products + integrations, all while staying relatively decentralized. How is this possible?</p>\n<p>Crypto uses public private key cryptography, a form of one-way function that makes id verification fairly easy and id stealing fairly hard. These ids are called addresses and the money you have is associated with the given id. This means that decentralized financial portals can exist, since we can verify who id making the transaction and prevent fund stealing.</p>\n<p>Decentralized finance, defi, sprung up from ethereum and it's notion of programmable money. If one looks at the existing traditional financial system, one sees a system full of contracts enforced by law. Vitalik Buterin had the insight to create these things called smart contracts, executable pieces of code on the blockchain. By enforcing code as law, we can emulate much of what tradfi does at much faster speeds and much lower operating costs. The developments also compound since they can be tighly integrated with one another, meaning that development in the crypto space develops much more rapidly. Since it's all code, everything is also more traceable and more debuggable. You are less likely to have a wire stuck somewhere in the bank's pipeline.</p>\n<p>To use defi, you'll need to get off a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance and get your own wallet. The traditional wallet of choice has been Metamask for the Ethereum ecosystem, although others will suffice. I'm familiar with the cosmos ecosystem, so my wallet of choice there would be keplr.</p>\n<p>Once you've entered defi you'll see all these terms being thrown around. There's all these different apps and tokens: compound, balancer, sushiswap, pancakeswap, osmosis, etc. Go ahead and pick any of them. The most important thing to understand is that if you don't have any idea what the fuck is happening, its probably better to not ape in, but rather dump a small amount first. The strategies in question may have different protocol implementations that can lead to drastic differences so unless you're very aware of <em>exactly</em> how the bonding curve is supposed to operate, you shouldn't ape in. As you do this more, you should get a general feel of it and you can disregard this.</p>\n<p>There are several different ways to make money in the defi ecosystem so far. Here I'll talk about staking and liquidity mining. There's a ton of other interesting financial products, but I don't have much experience with them so I won't get into those.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is proof of work. This means that as it scales, the amount of energy it consumes increases vastly. It's still probably less than our current financial system, but there's room for improvement. Other chains secure themselves via proof of stake, where assets are use as collateral (staked) to secure the network. You are incentivized to stake because the chain is inflationary and yields rewards to those who stake. The downside is that whatever assets you stake are illiquid for the duration of the staking and have an unbonding period. There's been cool stuff done by lido.fi with liquid staking and token equivalents akin to that of a cex, but we'll not get into that.</p>\n<p>Staking is relatively low risk and will yield token rewards from anywhere between 10% to some insane APY. APY is annual percentage yield compounded for the entire year; you'll want to convert it to APR, the annual percent rate you get per day. You can expect that if the APY you have at the start is insane, that the token/coin staking rewards will deflate accordingly until the yield is in more of a normal range. Any token with a high staking APY is probably also due for a decent amount of price swings, but altogether we don't really care since all we care about is the price being higher at a fixed point, say a couple weeks from now.</p>\n<p>Liquidity mining is inherently more risky than staking. Liquidity mining aims to replicate the function of a centralized exchange by incentivizing people to join pools and providing liquidity. The APYs will often be much higher reflecting this risk. Liquidity mining means you place your tokens in a pool for other people to exchange. When doing liquidity mining, the best case scenario involves both tokens in question moving upwards in tandem, followed by sideways trading. If tokens move in opposite directions, you are at risk of impermanent loss, where you can lose tokens. As the tokens change directions, some people will take advantage of the arbitrage, resulting in lost tokens. Liquidity mining may be less profitable than simply holding the tokens if this is the case.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the rewards from liquidity mining more often than not will outpace impermanent losses. Additionally, there are different risk profiles for different liquidity mining pools. If you are providing liquidity to a pool of stablecoins, coins that see very little price action since they are designed to be stable, the risk of il is pretty much nil. As you move into pools with more shadier, less proven tokens, the APY should probably be higher in reflection of the fact that some price movement is expected.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"an-introduction-to-defi"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
