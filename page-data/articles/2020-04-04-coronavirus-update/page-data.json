Things have changed remarkably in the span of a couple weeks, eh?</p>\n<p>Let’s recap what’s happened so far, for those uninitiated.</p>\n<h2>my purpose</h2>\n<p>I’m Jonathan and I’m trying to work towards accelerating human-centered progress. I am working on launching a startup that will help you define exactly what your goals and priorities are (through a rule-based calendar). This lets you work towards them without having a super rigid schedule. A large percentage of people hate structure and rightly so, but the ideal path is semistructured in order to define what the problem is.</p>\n<h2>what I was doing pre-covid</h2>\n<p>Pre-covid I was attempting to juggle three things: building this startup, doing my university work, and working on cognition research. I did this fairly well the first couple of weeks, but as the weeks wore on, I was getting less and less effective at doing so.</p>\n<h2>where it all went to hell</h2>\n<p><strong>week 1</strong>\nSo there’s some debate on when COVID-19 actually reached and spread. What I know, is that the timing of when I first got sick (whether it was a cold / fever or COVID) was awfully terrible. It was a test week, and me being me, I did not ask for help / nor email in sick so I bombed everything. This was around the time Wuhan announced that they had discovered coronavirus, but they suppressed information and hoped it would blow by so make of that what you will.</p>\n<p>I know my symptoms were very much aligned with the symptoms of COVID-19, although I didn’t know it then, given that no one in this country was really paying attention to it. I had a severe dry cough, a fever, and believe I lacked more taste and smell than I usually did. No one was doing COVID-19 testing at the time, and I had stayed literally at home all winter break, so I held (at the time) that the chances of me having COVID-19 were highly unlikely. I rarely get sick, and when I do get sick, I usually recover rather quickly, in a couple of days, if not a day.</p>\n<p>This cold / fever / COVID / whatever was on and off throughout the next two weeks. I had one particular day, where after I got back to my apartment, I literally needed to go to sleep immediately. Work was a wash that week; I could not get anything done.</p>\n<p><strong>week 2</strong></p>\n<p>Week 2 involved me still being sick and taking an algorithms test that I bombed because I could not study because the day before I literally lost motor control of my body while standing in a bus. At an appointment the next day, the nurse stated that my feverish symptoms from before combined with the heat of the bus caused me to feel dizziness (around the ears), and eventually lose motor control.</p>\n<p>At this point, my priorities radically changed from doing what I was doing (e.g. my startup and schoolwork) to literally just making it out alive.</p>\n<p><strong>middle weeks</strong></p>\n<p>Week 3 involves uncertainty and trying to make up schoolwork. As a person who is Heavily Online, Twitter really started sounding off alarm bells, particularly in VC land. They were way ahead of the CDC and WHO on that one.</p>\n<p>The Ivy League schools were the first ones to act towards moving classes online. They were already on break and it made sense to pause classes given the wealthy composition of their parents, students, and alumni. Online coursework was also more seamless relatively compared to other colleges given that they had spent fortunes developing things like MIT Opencourseware. Online courseware production is <a href=\"https://raccoongang.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-create-online-course/\">highly expensive</a>.</p>\n<p>Given that I do not live on my college campus, I did not have to worry about getting kicked out. What I did have to worry about, was the supply-chain. Binghamton is a ‘city’, but not a ‘city’ in the same way that New York, Los Angeles, or Toronto is. You can’t walk a couple of blocks and try a new restaurant every day. You can’t go to the supermarket on the way back home to pick ingredients for dinner each night. It’s inefficient.</p>\n<p>I don’t have a car and primarily rely on the bus (from my stop to campus to walmart/target/wegmans) to get groceries. There is no dedicated supermarket located in my area. I can bike to the Weis which takes around 30-ish minutes one way give or take, but there is a limited amount which I can bike on a day to day basis.</p>\n<p>This left me in a period of relative food insecurity. Amazon was starting to take hits in terms of package delivery time and stock so that was becoming a no-go. Food delivery was an option, but one of the primary reasons for living off-campus was reduced living costs.</p>\n<p>As the campus bus service shuttered to weekend hours, and then later to virtually no hours (the ETA spot system is already kinda irreliable), it became obvious to me that I was not in an ideal position.</p>\n<p>My dad ended up driving me back to New York. New York was not quite the epicenter that it has become, but the cases were definitely growing.</p>\n<p>As Cuomo and NYS moved from making certain social distancing guidelines mandatory towards full shelter-in and quarantine, I had become gradually more depressed, especially given the fact that my workload had not really reduced.</p>\n<p><strong>later weeks</strong></p>\n<p>My sleep schedule, already erratic after coronavirus started becoming mainstream, became even worse. As I type this, it is almost 4am in the morning. I literally cannot wake up and go to sleep at normal hours.</p>\n<p>Online classes have been completely different from in-person ones. Online classes have been more or less neglected and I think the quality of instruction has taken a sharp nosedive. We have to consider the environment we are in. We are literally in an environment reminiscent of the Great Depression. People are getting sick, the infrastructure is overburdened, the economy is all over the place, unemployment is sky-rocketing. I literally cannot focus on my school work given all this.</p>\n<p>People are dying. People are getting laid off by the second.</p>\n<p>I’m an optimistic person and think that we will get through this; that it’s not the end of the world. With us quarantined at home, I think that there is a case to be made that there will be a large amount of innovation at time.</p>\n<p>Yet, I also know that the end is likely not near. Naval Ravikant, with all his faults, is right that we need to crush the curve rather than flatten it. A vaccine is projected to take at least a year (something I randomly opened up to with a guy at the Weis supermarket) which is the cure-all. Testing rollout has been uneven. Front liners are getting infected. We are stuck in a boom and bust cycle where even if we flatten the curve, political and business pressure to resume normal economic activity will push us into waves of coronavirus until herd immunity has effectively been achieved. Several hundred thousand Americans are projected to die.</p>\n<p>One thing that America does not have going for it is a centralized response. China, despite all it’s authoritarian faults, is able to coordinate an out-sized directed response. In the United States, there has been almost no coordination, with the ineptitude (specifically for mask buying) being at an all-time high.</p>\n<p>Congress has been given a golden opportunity to restructure the economy and bake in some anti-fragility, but they somehow managed to pass a bill that was worse that what most people could dream of. In the 6 trillion (it’s reported at 2 trillion, but that doesn’t include everything) stimulus bill that got passed, the airline and cruise industry got bailed out big time, yet everyone else got a means-tested single check for $1200. There is a funny <a href=\"https://brrr.money\">page</a> about Fed Reserve money injection into the economy which is highly relevant.</p>\n<p>With that 2 trillion, they literally could’ve saved every small business and give out unemployment benefits to everyone that filed for it.</p>\n<p>Even with the money that they’ve given, it’s unclear when we’ll receive it. They’re taking a 3 week vacation during the middle of a national crisis. The money is supposed to go to the banks and flow down the pipeline which will take weeks and I haven’t heard of anyone who has received it.</p>\n<p>The fact of the matter is that <strong>people need the money now.</strong> There have been efforts made by philantropists like Jack Dorsey and Bill Gates and trades unions / guilds like the Actors Fund, but these efforts are singular in nature. In the case of the philanthropists it is contained towards their online audience and who they know. In the case of the trade unions, it is directed towards their own members.</p>\n<p>Platforms like Patreon have been used creatively to generate income, but the fact remains that Patreon is built for someone who has an audience already. It doesn’t provide any tools or ways to find recommendations for what businesses are in your local area, how much they might need, or how close they are to the brink of failure.</p>\n<p>What we need is an approach that is cognizant of the problem. Coronavirus is a virus that distributes itself spatially, which disrupts geospatial economic activity. We need to engage with the virus economically on the same level, through localized recommendations for which businesses need the help the most.</p>\n<p>With a vaccine nowhere in the near future, we need to work towards helping the businesses that have seen the greatest drop in cash flow. In this case, these restaurants are experienced-based. If you’ve been to a fine dining establishment, amusement park, dentist, or barber, you’ve been to an experience-based place.</p>\n<p>Switching to a delivery-based model is simply not possible for the majority of these experience-based businesses. What we need to do is startup economics. We need to give them enough runway to successfully return to running their business in an economic climate that is hopefully more hospitable.</p>\n<p>I believe that the best way to do this is through pre-ordering and reserving experiences. Similar to presales of a book, we need to presell experiences in order to get through this tough time.</p>\n<p>It is fair to say that a large percentage of small businesses are at a complete loss in terms of switching their business model. We are now asking them to suddenly become more technology-inclined, to be able to develop an ecommerce store, successfully market it, in order to adapt runway, for something that will likely no longer be relevant or valuable in a couple of months.</p>\n<p>They don’t need a piece of complex software such as Shopify with all its integrations and bells and whistles given the temporariness of this arrangement. What they need, is something that puts them on their customers maps as fast as possible, with little overhead. Given all the grants, unemployment benefits, and other paperwork that is being filled out, friction reduction is a must. Geographic distribution based on a set of customers is more likely to evenly spread out the money based off communities and help those who are disadvantaged and in need.</p>\n<p>My depression (and burnout) appears to be fading away, so I’ll be hacking on this thing this weekend and hoping that this thing will have a real impact.</p>\n<p>Hope you stay safe. If you are unsure of what information to trust, rest assured that there is a ton of disinformation out there, but <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org\">Our World in Data</a> has our backs.</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember that in times of trouble, there is always an urge to play the blame game to return ourselves to a semblance of normalcy. I push you to hold in this urge, in recognition that there is a problem, and that playing the blame game ultimately does not help make the situation better (Germany in WWI is a textbook example). Energy is better devoted to solving the problem, that pretending that it doesn’t exist or pointing fingers.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020-04-04-coronavirus-update"}}}
