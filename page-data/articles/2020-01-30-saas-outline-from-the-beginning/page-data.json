I'm at the point in creating this business <a href=\"https://banh.app\">banh</a> where I really don't know what I'm doing, but smart people tell me that nobody really knows what they're doing.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, if this somehow pans out (first time I'm going more all in than usual), then here's a documented journey of how this all happened.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>CSPLASH event at Yale (I think ~2016)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a kid, I went to some university enrichment thing called CSPLASH, that was aimed at having university students teach some subject to more middle school and high school level kids. One particular course I picked had something to deal with philosophy and AI, I really don't remember. What I do remember from it, was the guy talking about how sometimes he wished that his schedule was predetermined sometimes, so he could have the most optimal and efficient schedule. Didn't really think much of this.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Burned out junior year of high school (2017)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I went to a public school with a reputation of \"sink or swim\". I think it was a little overstated, but there definitely was burnout. I know people who ended up transferring elsewhere. Anyways, the workload and my habits were unsustainable with the environment and I burned out junior year. One thing I think people sometimes fail to notice is how much of the things that we do are forces of habit. If I fail to turn in one assignment, the shock value of breaking the habit usually means that the end result is fine. But with burnout, with work just piling up, you just can't get yourself to face it. It's just an endless slog of stuff being thrown at you, and it actually feels good ignoring it.</p>\n<p>Of course, there were real world implications of this. I just sorta sleep walked through the end of junior year, just waiting, just begging for it to finish. Grades suffered, so things got iffy. Really didn't have any ideas for addressing this, just wanted to get high school finished and hopefully get into a \"good\" college.</p>\n<p>Whenever I complained about my workload on doctor visits, my pediatrician would state that it wasn't actually unreasonable and that I should've managed my time better.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Built an MVP of an online live LaTeX document editor. Stalled. (2018)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This was when I first registered banh's domain name, and put up a simple mailchimp list. I somehow got 15 people to subscribe to it, despite literally no marketing. I ended up getting tangled with college, and progress on the editor stalled. </p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Abandoned the editor. (2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I envisioned a sort of google docs alternative, but had trouble setting user authentication setup, and really lost interest in finishing the project, given some personal life difficulties I was going through.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><a href=\"https://treehacks.com\">TreeHacks</a> (february 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was going through the regular motions of life, when I got an email saying that I had been accepted to TreeHacks. As a habit from high school, I tend to just mass apply to hackathons, without really thinking about it. I ended up going, and found some really inspiring work and talks. The Bay Area just has a completely different vibe about it. This made me realize that building a startup was not a far off fantasy.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>Did parts of fast.ai course (summer 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I didn't land a job or internship for the summer, so I spent my summer attending tech meetups, database conferences, going to coworking locations (A/D/O !!!), and taking online MOOCs. fast.ai was particularly useful.</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>Started listening to <a href=\"\">Indie Hackers</a> (august 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Indie Hackers is an insanely good podcast about how to build something from the absolute starting point. I had been thinking of establishing sources of passive income, but found current books to be to general. Really kept this on the backburner while mostly listening to TWIML.</p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>Created a Simplenote idea note (september 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I keep all my ideas in simplenote, another insanely good application.  fast.ai + attending a couple of AI talks had let me to believe I was an AI god despite me knowing jack shit, so I titled my note appropriately:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scheduler which uses ai to best optimize your schedule.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then again most of my ideas in my list are fairly farfetched, so this was one of the more promising ones. Left it in the idea list, while I pondered other stuff.</p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>Had a call with a VC (spoiler: rejected) (november 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I had subscribed to some VC email newsletter in high school for some reason (I did weird things in high school like subscribing to upenn's job listserv and running firebase and webapps using my school email) and ended up doing a call with a VC about the feasibility of my idea. He was nice enough to not tell me my idea was absolutely terrible, given Gcal's prevalence and my incoherent rambling.</p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>Joined university entrepreneurship club (november 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Had meant to do this in september, but it rained and my computer was in my backpack and I didn't have an umbrella and you know what happened. I'm fairly antisocial unless you're talking about being weird, philosophizing about life, or like talking about tech-related stuff. My ideal preference is to be an onlooker to these sorts of conversations, rather than being an active participant, but whatever.</p>\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li>Realized <a href=\"https://figma.com\">figma</a> existed and is insanely good. (december 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Winter break came, and I didn't really have much to do. Got rejected from all the stuff I had applied to. I decided to try to make use of the time by building something out. The scheduler thing was on the back of my mind, having been my most recent thought, so I decided to work on that. Signed up for the awesome figma student plan (it's free!) and learned how to build shitty mockups (still so much better than my previous design abilities).</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>Signed up for <a href=\"https://getmakerlog.com\">makerlog</a>. (december 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I realized that I needed to find a way to keep myself accountable. <a href=\"https://getmakerlog.com/\">Makerlog</a> is really a good way of maintaining habit streaks and helps pressure you to consistently get stuff done.</p>\n<ol start=\"13\">\n<li>Pivoted the banh.app domain to calendar. (december 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hadn't done work on the editor app for months, so I killed it and replaced it with a landing page. I intended for banh.app to now be a mobile app given convenience and mobile dominance.</p>\n<ol start=\"14\">\n<li>Discovered that google play and revenue forward SaaS apps aren't exactly compatible. (december 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>See title; pivoted towards a webapp with mobile apps being down the line for the future.</p>\n<ol start=\"15\">\n<li>Joined Twitter. Discovered Naval Ravikant and dhh. (december 2019)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He has some insanely good and forward tweets. I don't necessarily agree with everything, but his general life philosophy (on things like truth, building businesses, etc.) are sound.</p>\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li>Read Patrick Collison's website and joined <a href=\"https://pioneer.app\">pioneer</a> competition (january 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Patrick Collison's advice page is really good and I highly recommend it. I'm not anti-VC, but acknowledge VCs current faults. Pioneer seems to be the good side of VCs and there's a really low barrier of entry, given the fact that it's remote.</p>\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li>Applied to <a href=\"https://www.startupschool.org/\">YC Startup School</a> (the online one) (january 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I find the motivation tool to be highly useful. I'm kinda behind on the talks lol.</p>\n<ol start=\"18\">\n<li>Read Cal Newport's <a href=\"https://unintendedcon.github.io/articles/2020-1-17-notes-on-cal-newport&#x27;s-deep-work\">Deep Work</a>. (january 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This led me to a paradigm shift. My previous idea was really AI and data science your way towards optimal schedule. There wasn't anything quite tangible in terms of how exactly I was gonna get to where I wanted.</p>\n<ol start=\"17\">\n<li>Pivoted idea towards addressing burnout and created spec. (january 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was previously going with a target audience of freelancers, a group that is only growing, given the growing realization that with the gig economy, people can make not just extra cash on the side, but make freelancing their full time job.</p>\n<p>I think the current pitch at the time: a smart calendar, was ok, but it could be better improved.</p>\n<p>While filling out the <a href=\"https://pioneer.app\">pioneer</a> project description, I realized that I had never created a spec to clearly identify how I would proceed. This was why I was stuck in a roadblock, instead of making progress.</p>\n<p>In making this spec (done in notion; it's pretty cool!), I realized that a better pitch would be pivoting towards burnout. I burned out for a whole year which negatively affect my productivity, impacting my potential career prospects. This was just in school too. Work is often a constant slog if there's no implicit motivation (\"flow\") involved. Having read \"Deep Work\" and remembering my pediatrician's comments, I resolved to pivot towards a calendar that enabled you to flexibly reschedule events as smoothly as possible. This would reduce downtime, which is often lost to shallow activities that don't have much productivity. In short, banh would now enable you to optimize your time to focus on the things that matter. Burnout statistics are fairly easy to find online, and I'm fairly aware of how much of a pain it can be, especially with unfair deadlines and large workloads. There are some cases where there's a set amount of work and you just have to do it. Having a calendar that could enable you to do this in the shortest amount of time seemed intriguing.</p>\n<p>One example found in Deep Work is that of dhh and basecamp. Despite reducing the workweek from 5 to 4, there was no loss of productivity. This was because the time lost was mostly devoted to shallow work. Busyness != productivity.</p>\n<p>The optimal schedule is arguably semistructured, where you have goals and your tools work towards helping you achieve those goals as fast as possible. I think that this optimisation is helpful for burnout; I think this was a key difference between people like me and the people in my high school who succeeded. They had already internalised optimization (they also were smarter than me). Spending time on reddit is nice, but for the most part it doesn't help me achieve my goals.</p>\n<ol start=\"18\">\n<li>Wasted time debating what cutting edge framework I should use (january 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I wasted too much time debating what tech I'm gonna use to do this. It's final; I'm sticking with <a href=\"https://nextjs.org\">next.js</a>, express, react and redux. Tried to get auth running; took a while. This was the time period in which I wrote the regrettable Why is Web Dev so Hard post.</p>\n<ol start=\"19\">\n<li>Furthered technical documentation for spec. (january 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Done in basic math review class. I would put an image of the schema here, but I haven't setup images on blog posts yet 😂.</p>\n<ol start=\"20\">\n<li>Now. Building component infrastructure. (end of january, 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I've always been baffled by javascript in general and react proved no different. I had already learned the basics of react last year, but redux was like a completely new language, like Sanskrit or something. Reducers. Action types. Action creators. Stores. In Flutter, with provider, you just had providers and consumers. I favor learning from official documentation and blog tutorials over video, but I literally could not understand redux whatsoever from the documentation. They just threw so many terms at you, without fully explaining them. Luckily for me, Freecodecamp exists thanks to the determined efforts of one Quincy Larson. Quincy Larson has done a service for humanity. I'm now working towards mapping out best practices for how redux should be used in a project, and then mapping out the state model.</p>\n<ol start=\"21\">\n<li>Computer crashed. (jan 29, 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This tends to happen when you try to run fedora on windows hardware with the nouveau drivers. It tends to brick your OS completely (firefox does this too; go chronium derivatives!).</p>\n<ol start=\"22\">\n<li>Nothing meaningful. (jan 30, 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Slept in. Attended a meeting. Wrote a blog post. Literally got nothing done (besides repairing the OS; its like functional, but barely). I need this software more than anything.</p>\n<ol start=\"23\">\n<li>Working on prototype (feb 7, 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Had a startup school video call update yesterday. Went to incubator and got some work done there. Class is cancelled today because of snowstorm!!!</p>\n<ol start=\"24\">\n<li>Got sick (feb 17th, 2020 - feb 24th, 2020)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Entire week got burned recovering (+ taking midterms). Next week is making up the loads of schoolwork that's piled up.</p>\n<ol start=\"25\">\n<li>The Future.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Get the prototype / necessary features working. Set a subscription model. </p>\n<p>Create new features. Release to users. Get feedback. Iterate. Repeat.</p>\n<p>Hopefully outsource marketing to someone who's much more knowledgeable about that than me.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you want to sign up as a beta user, you can do so <a href=\"https://banh.app\">here</a>.
