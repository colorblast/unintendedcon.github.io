It has recently seen upwards price action, going from lows of 3ish USD - 6ish USD to roughly 30 something USD at the moment of this writing. There are several reasons for why Luna has risen dramatically. In order to effectively do this, we will first explore the background for why Terra exists, why Terra was at the price it was at back in May and June, what changed in between, and what we can expect in the future.</p>\n<h2>Introduction (or how Terra came to be)</h2>\n<p>There are a ton of blockchains out there. Plenty of them. xdai. matic. rootstock. bitcoin. bitcoin sv. bitcoin cash. ethereum, etc (this is a pun). It's fairly easy to create a blockchain given that most of the code is open source and you easily fork quality audited code. Tech was not the issue.</p>\n<p>The issue, as Do Kwon and Daniel Shin (the founders of Terra) saw it, was that crypto was not really user-interfacing. As much as you and I hodl and buidl, the majority of people are looking for easy user experience, easy onboarding, and little to no volatility. Large candles are not for everyone.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/HOIXHJ24HBETZFIF7PDPVRPROQ.jpg\" alt=\"Kwon and Shin\"></p>\n<p>Kwon and Shin<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> decided to create a token, Luna, that would be used in conjunction with various stablecoins, but initially the korean won, followed by the us dollar. KRT was important because both of these guys had a background in ecommerce in Korea, working with the Terraform Alliance. This allowed them to use the KRT to process payments for apps like Chai and serve already existing use cases. This was a win-win since it helped bootstrap Luna while also reducing inefficiencies in payment processing for these companies.</p>\n<p>Luna derives value from these stables since you need Luna in order to mint them. You can also burn these stables to get Luna. The algorithm behind this ensures that the arbitrage is greater when the stablecoin is farther from the peg, ensuring a price that will be consistent or near consistent with the oracle.</p>\n<p>Do Kwon and Terra would release two major updates fueled by these two stablecoins, <a href=\"https://mirror.finance/\">Mirror Protocol</a> and <a href=\"https://anchorprotocol.com/\">Anchor Protocol</a>. Mirror has a similar process to Luna; it enables anyone to mint governance-approved synthetic assets (things like stocks, other cryptocurrencies, and index funds) with Mirror and uses arbitrage to keep the peg. Anchor Protocol is a savings protocol, where arbitrage enables a fixed yield rate on UST (the currency pegged to the dollar).</p>\n<p>As you can see, the stables are algorithmic. This would be a problem later.</p>\n<h2>Trouble Brews</h2>\n<p>At the turn of the new year of 2021, crypto exploded. Absolutely exploded. Bitcoin pushed up. Ethereum pushed up. Alts followed. <em>Terra pumped hard.</em> The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/01/gamestop-origins/\">WallStreetBets push</a> and the hype around GME, AMC, NOKIA, and Dogecoin meant stock market speculation galore. COVID-19 checks in the US helped as well.</p>\n<p>Now the complicated term for what this is called is reflexity. It was coined by Soros in some <a href=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2014/01/13/fallibility-reflexivity-and-the-human-uncertainty-principle-2/\">fancy paper or blog post</a>; I don't quite remember. But the gist of it is that since markets are not perfectly efficient and humans are more irrational than rational, bubbles can emerge and be sustained by perception since there is no consensus of reality. The problem, of course, is that we haven't figured out a way to make these bubbles last forever, so when they tank, and they do tank, they tank hard.<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/d9515564-82e0-43fa-b2ca-e174ab631278/f5f441b2-c83c-4ee6-b016-ee8554fd96e7\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Unfortunately, since Luna is tied to UST, a bear run caused UST to be depegged from its place around $1. <a href=\"https://app.flipsidecrypto.com/dashboard/how-ust-is-not-collateral-backed-comparing-its-algorithm-mechanism-in-may-vs-the-recent-2-weeks-G0vbPF\">UST fell to around 90ish or so cents for a period of time, before rebounding</a>. Much of the gains and action from the previous bull market cycle had been retail and one-time. Stimulus checks were not given again. Any existing money retail had in the market was largely liquidated. Institutions and enterprises have not quite made the move to fully onboard with even blue chip cryptocurrencies so Luna could not rely on any sort of floor from this segment. The end result was Luna falling from its 20 or so high all the way down to 3 something USD as the entire crypto market tanked. Amid uncertainty and FUD around bitcoin, the leading indicator for ethereum, which is the leading indicator for alts, many investors simply withdrew from the crypto market.</p>\n<p>But not the hodlers. Not those with diamond hands.</p>\n<h2>And The Moon Rises</h2>\n<p>Luna saw a large degree of FUD during this time. However, Do Kwon and the development team were busy. Mirror Finance had been released in late 2020 the previous year. This time, they released Anchor, their savings protocol. Anchor was met with an underwhelming launch, but it set up the base building blocks for the future ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Luna did two things in the following time. Firstly, it established partnerships with many other networks, creating bridges to bridge UST to. They added bridges to Ethereum, BSC (which was hot at the time), and Harmony. They also raised a ton of capital to accelerate the building of their ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The previous building blocks would be able to start paying dividends with the upcoming update. Luna, built on an older version of the Cosmos SDK, is currently fairly limited in terms of what it can do. The upcoming Columbus-5 integration clears aways these concerns, burns LUNA seignorage (fees that would otherwise go to the community pool), and integrates with the larger Cosmos ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The first enables Terra itself to thrive with Anchor and Mirror serving as composable blocks. We've already seen projects like Spectrum (yield aggregation) and Pylon (idos) debut. There are more on the way. Projects like Alice, ApolloDao, Orion, Kujira, Loop, and Vega will enable Terra to serve a myriad of different use cases, whether it be yield aggregation, derivatives, marketing, liquidations, gaming, launchpads, recurring cash flows, pooling, or lending.</p>\n<p>The second results in more Luna deflation.</p>\n<p>The last integrates it into the greater Cosmos ecosystem. This is still nascent, but here's a picture of what it might look like and be.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cldup.com/w08khiOGW7.png\" alt=\"Cosmosian Federation\"><sup id=\"fnref-3\"><a href=\"#fn-3\" class=\"footnote-ref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bridging from Luna to Cosmos to Thorchain will enable easy cheap transfers to bitcoin, ethereum, monero, polygon, and bsc for one, and all the future projects that develop in the ecosystem. Projects that realize that they may be better served on their own separate blockchain where they control network, governance, and gas parameters may build in this ecosystem instead of relying solely on tokens.</p>\n<h2>To Conclude</h2>\n<p>So why has Luna seen all this upwards price action?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Luna's price was dented earlier due to its tokenomics depegging UST</strong>, causing trust in UST to drop. This has since recovered and UST has not depegged significantly since.</li>\n<li><strong>Terra has increased partnerships with other networks, creating pools of UST</strong> to boost Luna.</li>\n<li><strong>Stablecoins are on an upwards trend</strong>, with people increasingly relying on them to bridge volatility and inflation for their native currencies. They are also better for persistent revenue flow for some people.</li>\n<li>Network <strong>updates cause Luna to deflate</strong> at a greater rate than before due to burning.</li>\n<li>Terra's <strong>investments in it's ecosystem</strong> and base layer have paid off.</li>\n<li>Terra will be <strong>strongly coupled with two other strong and growing ecosystems</strong> in the form of Cosmos and Thorchain.</li>\n<li>Greater <strong>macro factors</strong> i.e. the crypto market became bullish again.</li>\n<li>Luna has a strong, insanely <strong>strong community</strong> that allowed it to survive the bear crash.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lunatics&#x26;src=typed_query\">#Lunatics gang</a>.</p>\n<h2>appendix</h2>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn-1\">\n<p>Credit to Coindesk for the image plus initial launch news.</p>\n<a href=\"#fnref-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">â†©</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-2\">\n<p>This data shows the spread across the Luna pools on Ethereum vs the Luna oracle prices.
