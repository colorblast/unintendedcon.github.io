The gist of the provision is that companies are not liable for the third-party content that they host on their platform as long as they make a good-faith effort at compliance. This provision is the legal foundation for most existing Internet infrastructure, whether it be Youtube, social media, or photo-sharing sites.</p>\n<p>For most of the Internet's short life span, politicians have been relatively content to back off and let the Internet do its thing. The few times that they tried to tamper with it were rebuffed, as we saw with the 2012 SOPA/PIPA net neutrality protests. </p>\n<p>The times are different now. The blue party claims that social media is elevating and promoting fringe voices. These fringe voices are amplified and become mainstream. Their evidence typically is Facebook's top posts leaning red party. They also point to the relative ease at which conspiracies and \"fake news\" spread across a social media network. Posts that go viral are often heavily emotional, misleading, and overly reductive, if not outright false. These concerns are valid.</p>\n<p>The red party claims censorship. Their viewpoint stems from free-market principles and our right to freedom of speech. In their view, red party content and values are rightly more popular, and no tampering should happen. They often allege that moderation will result in a chilling effect, where we censor ourselves and others. The result is an Orwellian 1984 where no one has the ability to express how they truly feel about things. These concerns are also valid.</p>\n<p>The blue party's first line of attack is that tech companies are companies. Since they're companies and not the government, they can do what they want. Just like a company can fire you at will, a social media platform can establish community rules. If you violate these rules, you can be kicked off the platform. This viewpoint is epitomized by <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1357/\">xkcd</a>.</p>\n<p>This makes sense if you're assembling a community of you and your friends. Your specific clique is interested in having a consensus set of rules that you all abide by. If someone's being an asshole, you should be able to kick them out.</p>\n<p>Many early Internet communities and forums follow this model, so it's no surprise that Randall Munroe, the creator of xkcd, feels this way.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, this argument fails to hold water. The problem is scale.</p>\n<h2>The corporate state</h2>\n<p>How big is Facebook? Twitter? Youtube?</p>\n<p>Facebook's number of users is <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/facebook-is-bigger-than-the-worlds-largest-country/\">larger than the population of China</a>, the world's largest country.</p>\n<p>Social media, in principle, should operate as a network of clusters. More realistically, it operates as a public square. Everybody shouts into the void and hopes that someone out there agrees with you or finds your content interesting.</p>\n<p>Right now, the blue party is probably shouting that you don't have to use the platform. You, with your free-market principles, can always switch. If you don't like the app, then don't use it.</p>\n<p>This seems reasonable at first inspection. Yet, when we look at the nature of social networks, we come to a starkly different conclusion.</p>\n<p>For one, social networks derive their power from their network. This value compounds for every person that joins it. This is known as a network effect.</p>\n<p>When people leave the network for alternatives, they don't get the same value. This is why Parler and Gab, two notorious red-party alternatives to Twitter and Reddit, aren't working. If we imagine <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTyg2E44pBA\">social media networks as economies</a>, this becomes more clear. A social media network exerts a dominant monopoly on a core network of people. Your alternative network cannot represent all possible views because of this monopoly. The people who like the network will stay; the people who get canceled (and generally more problematic) will leave. You get a feedback loop and the <a href=\"https://firstround.com/review/80-of-Your-Culture-is-Your-Founder/\">culture of the network</a> you've created becomes emblematic of this initial set of problematic tail-end users. </p>\n<p>The creation of a new social network needs to provide a significant value-add (as TikTok did) or it will become a cesspool.</p>\n<p>This monopoly thus becomes a chokepoint. Humans are a relatively social species, and we've moved a large portion of our interactions online. One could imagine a dystopian future where we still retain our freedom of speech, but no one can exert it since everyone communicates through the moderated Internet.</p>\n<p>The red party is probably exuberant now, but the issue becomes more complicated when we examine social media and it's incentives.</p>\n<h2>Incentives and Scale kill Free Speech</h2>\n<p>We have examined alternative social networks and have found them, for the most part, not viable. Due to incumbency effects, they become cesspools.</p>\n<p>We have not asked ourselves a vital question, however. Are our current social media networks already cesspools?</p>\n<p>The economics of social media is that of attention. Social media demands consumers so that these consumers will view its ads and then buy its products. This is its core business model.</p>\n<p>There are concerns that this <a href=\"https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-2/\">ad stuff is all a bubble</a>, but we'll ignore them for now.</p>\n<p>As logistics and technology have gotten better and better, the cost of them approaches zero. The resulting bottleneck isn't the delivery of services, but rather you.</p>\n<p>The fight for your attention is a weird one. It's a fight that got Wendy's to start <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2017/11/25/best-wendys-tweets-twitter-2017/\">talking smack on Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Beefin%3F\">release a rap album on Spotify</a>. Netflix claims that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40491939/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-sleep-is-our-competition\">its principal competitor isn't HBO, but sleep</a>. Many consultancies and media agencies have been formed to analyze and track consumer media habits.</p>\n<p>For social media networks, the end result is to serve you with whatever content keeps your eyeballs on the app. The result is that highly emotional content will go viral. Scott Alexander's post <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/\"><em>The Toxoplasma of Rage</em></a> is therapeutic. An organization like PETA is incentivized to be as controversial as possible so that they can reach more eyeballs, and rack in more donations. Compound this, and you can see why Extremely Online people are so unhinged.</p>\n<p>Scale also means a drastic decrease in good faith. The commoditization of the blogosphere has changed the way how we interact with others. There is more money to be made in becoming a caricature and virtue-signaling a core set of principles to our subgroups, rather than directly engaging questioners.</p>\n<p>The result is that without moderation, we get a ton of controversial stuff dumped down our throats, to provoke engagement. A cycle occurs, where you keep getting the same toxic stuff over and over again. Without moderation, the toxic supremacist stuff gets recycled over and over again. Utility of the network also decreases. If social networks with moderation are an echo chamber, social networks without moderation are an echo chamber that no one wanted. The disputes may be highly contested, but the same content gets echoed again and again. </p>\n<h2>The Publisher Stuff</h2>\n<p>The red party acknowledges this but says that all this moderation is still unfair. The platforms can moderate, but in a manner that is more red-party friendly. If a platform moderates, it becomes a publisher and should be subject to the same set of regulations that bound publishers. By platforming and deplatforming various people, the social media network acts more and more like an editorial board.</p>\n<p>The content on social media networks is primarily third-party though. Scale throws a wrench into the theory again. If this was a small number of vetted people, then sure it'd resemble an opinion section or journal. The sheer amount of content that goes through social media, however, means that the platforms more often act as the Overton window rather than outright censors something.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-reinstates-new-york-post-account-11604096659\">suspension of the NY Post's Twitter account</a> and <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/twitter-this-claim-is-disputed-meme/\">Twitter's moderation statements</a> are more publisher-like, but the majority of social networks still operate as platforms with a more hands-off policy.</p>\n<h2>Germany</h2>\n<p>The blue party likes looking to Europe. Here, they cast their eyes at Germany, with its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a\">banning of Nazism</a>. If Germany can operate fine (and it's looking great), why can't we do the same thing here?</p>\n<p>My contention here is that we don't have a consensus to do so. The Constitution is so powerful because the people who created it shared a fairly uniform consensus. As we have descended into our <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/how-fantasy-triumphed-over-reality-in-american-politics.html\">alternate realities</a>, where everything becomes politicized, our shared myth has shattered. The red party could argue slippery slope, that we'd start banning everything. This, by itself, is a fallacy, but the contention that there would be a higher probability is right. Germany's bans are enshrined in its constitution. To undo this would likely involve the destruction of the German state (and when that happens, this fight is irrelevant). Social media platforms don't have a founding moment where they established a core set of governmental rules. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"free-speech-does-not-scale"}}}
