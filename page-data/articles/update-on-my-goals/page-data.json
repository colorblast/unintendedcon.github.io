This seemed relatively easy at the time given that I had gotten on a pretty good roll. Nevertheless, I underwent a mental health crisis and nothing got published for three months. I've started to resume it now, and I think that I'll be able to publish my thoughts (for better or worse) on a bimonthly basis.</p>\n<p>The passive income one also didn't come to fruit as I pretty much abandoned everything. See above. I think I'm onto something, but I'm modifying the goalpost for it making money to before I graduate. I underestimated the time cost of building something unique as a person who doesn't do a ton of frontend stuff.</p>\n<p>The hackathon one was complete, but I do them all the time so there wasn't any real friction there. Hackathons went online also, making it even easier to participate (although potentially harder to collaborate).</p>\n<p>The conference one also didn't happen. I watched after-talks of Prisma Day, but I haven't applied to any conferences. I don't think I intend on any in the future also.</p>\n<p>The talk has not happened yet, and with COVID, the talk probably isn't gonna happen. Virtual talks are not the same.</p>\n<p>My flossing has not increased.</p>\n<p>After using makerlog for a couple weeks, I've pretty much abandoned it. It's fine, but my schedule feels highly irregular and not conducive to shipping day by day.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 has thrown a wrench in meeting people personally.</p>\n<p>It did the same with biking given New York instituted strict stay-at-home orders during the crisis.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty comfortable right now, so I don't think I did anything that was quite out of my comfort zone. Being a bit uncomfortable is a good thing.</p>\n<p>I think I'm gonna concentrate my efforts on three things: schoolwork, writing, and building a product. I stopped exercising regularly with this pandemic and I need to get on that asap. With the stuff that's happening, I'm not sure I'll get the chance to do that stuff openly outside in a couple months.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"update-on-my-goals"}}}
