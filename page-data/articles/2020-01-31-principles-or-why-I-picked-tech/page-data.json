My guiding principle is choice.","keywords":["tech","philosophy","life","bret victor","inventing on principle"]},"html":"<p>I was listening to the latest episode of Indie Hackers, where Courtland interviewed <a href=\"https://webflow.com\">Webflow's</a> founder Vlad Magdalin. Magdalin mentioned how he consistently tries to run his company based off his principles, and referenced one particular video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII\">inventing on principle</a> by Bret Victor. I had previously used Victor's library tangle before, but I had never listenened to his talk.</p>\n<p>After watching, I decided to figure out my guiding principles. There's several. I highly value freedom and authenticity. I think that the country needs to be better at being openly authentic, so that we know what we're working with and can work towards resolving our differences. I value freedom so much that I'm trying to do this company thing. Yet, the principle I believe I value most is choice.</p>\n<p>In web development, there should be a realistic alternative to the modern javascript ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In politics, there should be more viable alternatives than the current 2 party system, realistically. It presents a false dichotomy.</p>\n<h2>Tech and Choice</h2>\n<p>We've seen that with every major revolution, tech has brought more choice. </p>\n<p>With the Agricultural Revolution, we saw the rise of a class of people who didn't have to hunt or gather to make a living. Increased food production allowed occupations like blacksmiths, merchants, and engineers to exist. </p>\n<p>The Enlightenment and the printing press enabled the spread of so much knowledge. This spread enabled more people the choice to absorb this knowledge and do unprecedented things with it. Farmers had the choice to optimize to use the latest agricultural practices. More kids could see something like scientist as a viable career path.</p>\n<p>With the Industrial Revolution, we see the rise of transportation-related occupations in order to better serve the rail networks. We see more urban areas with more facilities and options for people to pick from. </p>\n<p>The Internet Age has brought unparalled mass communication and knowledge spread. I can instantly communicate and work with people in Poland or Italy or Texas from where I am (New York).</p>\n<p>I believe that technology provides a rising tide lifts all waves scenario. Increased technology and progress enable us to work from home, choose previously unviable occupations (youtuber one gen ago?), tackle censorship, and decrease the gap between rungs on the socioeconomic ladder.</p>\n<p>The important clause to all of this, is that this progress is opt-in instead of opt-out. It should not be an either-or scenario, where a company establishes a monopoly and completely eliminates the previously done method (this is why I support UBI). People should not be coerced into this progress.</p>\n<p>In terms of job loss, I believe that there will be net positive jobs for the future, and that companies should provide these workers with retraining programs.</p>\n<h2>How this reflects on what I've built</h2>\n<p>Banh is being created because the calendar market is kinda like this. Everyone relies on Gcal because of its tight integration with Gsuite. I feel like this is great and all, and that the team behind it has done a tremendous job towards building something that has lasted this long. Yet, I don't think it particularly addresses the specific problems of a person like me.</p>\n<p>My target audience is people who are in tight situations, where there is X amount of work that has to be done in order to achieve a certain goal, and that can't be avoided. This amount of work and stress can destroy a person's life. Things like sleep schedules can be messed up. Conflicts can occur, particularly in families. There can be signficant mental, physical, and emotional damage.</p>\n<p>I don't think there is quite a calendar that helps someone specifically deal with this problem, despite 23% of Americans reporting feeling burnt out. Given the advancements made in other industries (Superhuman for email, Figma for design), I think its time that the calendar worked with you, instead of against you, to achieve your designated goals.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020-01-31-principles-or-why-I-picked-tech"}}}
