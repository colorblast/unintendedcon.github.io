They're reinvesting their interest or capital gains into more stock or some other capital to generate more future capital inflow. In this article, I hope to rid you of the notion that compounding solely applies to finance and that you can apply it everywhere in your life.</p>\n<p>To begin this, I'd like to introduce the feedback loop. The feedback loop is a special type of iteration loop. For one, it is closed. The ideal feedback loop has a clear path delineation between each point so that observations and results can determine the next action. The military has its own name for this, the OODA loop. OODA stands for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act where the action feeds back into observation. This makes sense when one is thrust into an unfamiliar environment and needs to quickly understand one's surroundings. Ideal feedback loops are also fast. Fast loops give us more information to make better decisions. If the loop is not fast, it is advisable to break down the loop into smaller atomic loops.</p>\n<p>Compounding refers to actions that have attached feedback loops that affect you. If you exercise frequently, the probability that you are likely to continue to exercise is higher than that of a person who does not exercise frequently. Like investment compounding, investing in social, health, or skills capital also accrues gains. Social capital leads to a 'passive' return in the form of new opportunities and help, health capital leads to a return in emotional well-being and physical capability, and skills capital gives you leverage. That is not to say that all compounding is good. You can compound bad eating habits or unhealthy posture. Negative compounding follows a reverse asymptotic curve where skills or development quickly atrophies at the start before gradually slowing to its nadir.</p>\n<p>This stuff might seem like intuitive sense. Sure, I know all this, but how do I do this? I've tried doing this before, but it never seems to stick. Literally in the middle of writing this, I got super stuck trying to express my point.</p>\n<p>There are two fundamental issues: one is that people have a fundamental need for desire and two people will get the desire they need, regardless of whether it is positive or long-term, when they need it. I have a fundamental desire for certain things like achievement; achievement activates my serotonin. If I run into a rut, like I just did with writing this, I am tempted to switch from this task to reading some article or playing some game, where the intellectual simulation or reward factor provide my rush. Any sort of reward I derive from this passive action is rather fleeting and usually requires more investment in the form of time and energy for diminishing returns. This is counter to the curve for the hard things, which compound. Nevertheless, when the feedback loop for building a skill or becoming fit becomes unclear, the path forward becomes unclear. We fall back on our unhealthy defaults, using them as crutches. In order to avoid these crutches, we can break down the problem to make the feedback loops more clearer. If we are already stuck using our crutches, we need to jumpstart the positive feedback loop. You can do this by involving yourself in a more positive community of similarly-minded people (Alcoholics Anonymous, toastmasters), leaning into desire by finding something easily achievable yet notable for where you are (you can break this stuff down as well), and modifying our defaults. Some people run away from desire. Passion is inversely correlated to stability and income in one's career. This might work for some people. But from what I can tell, people are more effective when they care about what they're doing. There should be some overlap between the things you do and the desires you have. The way to beat addicting bad habits is to adapt addicting compounding good habits.</p>\n<p>For me, I find writing to be something I'm interested in and something I enjoy. I'm working on writing everyday, ideally earlier in the morning, so I can be more effective later.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you do find yourself in a rut, know that being in that rut with other people is both compounding and self-defeating. If you and your friends enjoy smoking together, you're compounding social capital while at the same time destroying health capital. It's your prerogative to decide whether or not this situation is healthy or worth it, and to make a decision based on it.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"personal-development"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
