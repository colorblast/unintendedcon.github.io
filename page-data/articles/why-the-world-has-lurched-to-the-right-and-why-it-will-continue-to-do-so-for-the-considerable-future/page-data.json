We explore why.","keywords":["chaos theory","governance","unpredictability","authoritarianism"]},"html":"<p>Across the globe, we are seeing the rise of authoritarianism and far-right parties. I expect this trend to keep growing, unless UBI is implemented.</p>\n<p>The world can be understood in terms of entropy and chaos. As we've moved from simple egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural ones to manufacturing ones to idea ones, the world has grown more and more unpredictable. Nassim Taleb talks about this stuff in his book The Black Swan. When more agents are introduced into an environment with their own incentives, the world becomes more random, non-linear, and fundamentally harder to predict.</p>\n<p>Humans, as I espouse again on this site, are fundamentally motivated by safetyism and loss aversion. Human history has had it's fair share of bad stuff happening when things like the stock market crash or a bubble bursts, so the majority of us have developed our lives around this fundamental need for safety. Our governments expand, our regulation expands; we invest in college, a job insurance program. Even as the price of this insurance expands, we choose to adopt it. It's the rational thing to do. Countless graphs have shown that realized income is much lower for those without degrees (although some of this is predetermined by self-selection). We deal with so much bs in order to make sure that we aren't relegated to the fringe of society.</p>\n<p>We are currently in the middle of a pandemic, economic depression, and a whole litany of other disasters, which I've documented extensively in other posts and won't go into further detail here.</p>\n<p>The result of the chaos of 2008 and now, is an increasingly unstable world. We are seeing democracies left and right become more authoritarian. Examples include <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/05/hungary-and-poland-arent-democratic-theyre-authoritarian/\">Hungary and Poland</a>. Freedom House has detailed how <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2020/leaderless-struggle-democracy\">India has become more nationalist</a> and how political parties are becoming more extreme. In Spain, Israel, and Austria, far-right parties have become more mainstream. Even in more socio-democratic countries like the <a href=\"https://jewishcurrents.org/the-new-dutch-far-right/\">Netherlands</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/10/world/europe/sweden-immigration-nationalism.html\">Sweden</a> are seeing the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-rise-of-sweden-democrats-and-the-end-of-swedish-exceptionalism/\">rise</a> of far-right parties.</p>\n<p>Authoritarians like Orb√°n are becoming the new norm as people turn to the person who can offer them security in the face of chaos.</p>\n<p>Socialism and labour make gains during chaos also, but they always lose. Humans are motivated by loss aversion, and given the unequal distribution present in society, those with wealth will largely back the far-right over the far-left. FUD of the Other and other tactics largely ensure that the far-right wins.</p>\n<p><strong>The world is poised to become even more authoritarian because we've merged market instabilities with human lives</strong>. Government insurance has worked against stemming the tide, but it is increasingly bloated, ineffective, and inefficient (bureaucratic asymptotic curve). Patrick McKenzie <a href=\"https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/\">documents</a> how in Japan startups are much harder because there is a strong bond between company and the individual. If you give your life to the company, the company is expected to provide for you, regardless of whatever happens. Japan remains a super strong democracy as a result with <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/japan/freedom-world/2020\">high</a> freedom house scores.</p>\n<p>The Enlightenment was possible because a bunch of men had this security, but did not have security in the idea space. The idea space, the right to free speech, has fueled a great deal of progress, but in our full-throated pursuit of said ideas, we've neglected our bodies.</p>\n<p>It's probably a good idea to explore UBI for all countries involved. The infighting between labor and owners has gone on for way too long when it's no longer necessary and frankly kinda dumb. <strong>The majority of people are ok with inequality as long as they can have peace of mind</strong>. We're so close to achieving unprecedented advances in space, life science, and exploration, but this is all moot if we let our world devolve into one where we can no longer exercise these idea freedoms.</p>\n<p>Democracy is often represented as an in-between for socialism and fascism. This may have been the case before given the need for exploitation, but given the abundance of the world, we can not only afford to give security to everyone, but it should net benefit our governance, businesses, and all members of society.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"why-the-world-has-lurched-to-the-right-and-why-it-will-continue-to-do-so-for-the-considerable-future"}}}
