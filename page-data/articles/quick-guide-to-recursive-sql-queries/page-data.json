We then specify the RECURSIVE option and give the query a name.</p>\n<p>Inside the query, we want to specify our starting node, the nodes we want to recurse through, and a JOIN statement where we relate the parent node to the child nodes.</p>\n<p>We can express the first two parts via a UNION ALL query since the node types should be the same. The JOIN statement will be on the property that expresses the relationship between the nodes.</p>\n<p>After you wrap up the WITH subquery, you can easily query it.</p>\n<p>For more on this, see <a href=\"https://www.sql-workbench.eu/comparison/recursive_queries.html\">https://www.sql-workbench.eu/comparison/recursive_queries.html</a>. </p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"quick-guide-to-recursive-sql-queries"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
