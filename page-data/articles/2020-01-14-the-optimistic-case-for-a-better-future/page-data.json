The future looks bright.</p>\n<p>Times appear to be dark. if you’re anything like me, a fairly independent and rational American thinker, it seems we’re mired in a swath of unrelenting human stupidity.</p>\n<p>Apparently Russia’s influenced the American elections. The media is full of lies. Homophobia and sexism seem rather pervasive. The situation in the Middle East is only getting worse, with countless innocents caught in the crossfire. Apparently young children are getting detained as they cross our borders. A recession seems in the works, with unemployment in Italy and Greece only increasing.</p>\n<p>That’s not to mention our environment, where deforestation and logging in the Amazon is causing strong repercussions to our climate. The U.S. is not a signatory to the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p>With all this suffering and problems, it’d appear like we are in a Dark Age. We don’t know it, but the case could be made.</p>\n<p>I don’t see things this way. Perhaps it’s my personality. Perhaps it’s my mindset. I think we’re on the cusp of a better society though. And no, I know you’re thinking, this is not one of those arguments you see made in TEDx talks, where some professor or business dude makes the argument that times are better than ever based off standard of living (at least not initially).</p>\n<h2>smarter people</h2>\n<p>I think the Internet Age has led to an unprecedented amount of knowledge share. There is typically a large amount of knowledge gain whenever a new easy and cheap transfer medium is created. The printing press by Johannes Gutenberg was one such invention. It sparked this little thing called the Enlightenment.</p>\n<p>The Enlightenment was not immediate. There were a limited amount of printing presses at first, and the people who were allowed to read, were mostly wealthy male intellectuals. These became the forefathers of the enlightenment.</p>\n<p>But gradually, as costs became cheaper, knowledge share diffused to everyone, even the people at the margins, creating a more well-informed society.</p>\n<p>It feels like everyone seems to forget that the Internet and the rise of the computer is extremely recent. Internet bandwidth is becoming increasingly faster (5G), and access to all sorts of households has increased. The racial disparity has dwindled, with most people having some form of computer or mobile phone access.</p>\n<p>There is also an increased case that people are consuming this information on the Internet. The average person gets so much screen time, that doctors have warned of the health effects of screen time, whether it be eye conditions, hand conditions, or mental health concern.</p>\n<p>I think this period could just as well be Enlightenment 2.0. This new generation (Gen Z) of people who have been exposed to so much knowledge transfer is moving towards the workforce, and increasing political and social power.</p>\n<p>Waitbutwhy is a great example of a weblog some random guy started, that is drastically increasing understanding. Instead of all this knowledge getting kept locked in the ivory tower, a simplified example gets diffused so that we get a better idea of how we work.</p>\n<h2>on homophobia and sexism</h2>\n<p>But wait, you ask. What about the homophobia and sexism? This country elected Donald Trump in 2016, something that appears to be every affirmation of negative racial and gendered sentiment.</p>\n<p>I subscribe to the viewpoint that those views were probably suppressed in the sense that they had no viable candidate who quite accurately represented them. They were always there, just waiting there in the veneer of the background.</p>\n<p>Ironically, I think Donald Trump’s presidency has done some good in the sense that it’s exposed some of this nation’s problems. These things were always there; we were just willfully ignoring it.</p>\n<p>It’s much like how Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein were doing these things for years, with all these people knowing what was happening, but doing nothing. They were complicit.</p>\n<p>Sure, finding out that we have all these problems and fissures hurt, but it’s better to find out now, than later on the road (unless you’re a president in which you do what’s best short-term).</p>\n<p>There will always be racist and homophobic people, but realizing that there is a problem and solving it through clear communication and open dialogue should enable a more united society.</p>\n<h2>economic hurt and climate change</h2>\n<p>I think economic hurt is directly tied to the problem with climate change.</p>\n<p>Greta Thunberg is absolutely correct in that we have a limited amount of resources. We’ve been forming our economic model around capitalism, whereby the key metric is growth. This has served us rather well, all things considering, as it’s (breaks promise) elevated living standards. The problem with growth, is that it has to be backed by things of value, things that are often tangible, such as natural resources. The standard was gold, but it can be extended to all resources.</p>\n<p>We’re increasingly running out of these resources, however. I think an economic recession coupled with the fact that we’re running out of resources, will lead us to rethink our current economic model. Things like cryptocurrency should maybe become the backbone of a new society.</p>\n<p>We can take inspiration from games, whereby certain items are ascribed a certain value. We need to move away from this reliance on physical resources to drive growth. Physical resources should possibly be considered a sort of utility that is necessary for infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Thus, economic recession should lead to greater net benefits, in that it makes us shrink out of our stupor, and reduce resource consumption.</p>\n<h2>Automation and UBI</h2>\n<p>John Maynard Keynes famously predicted that by the year 2000, we would have 15 hour workweeks. This has clearly not happened,  and it’s very intriguing to explore what went wrong.</p>\n<p>For one, it appears that most of us ascribe most of our value to our work. When we choose to describe ourselves to other people, the thing that comes out first is most often our occupation.</p>\n<p>There is nothing inherently wrong with that. But it’s driven this sort of workaholism, whereby people derive and feel like they have no reason to be here, except to fill their designated role. This, despite, a large chunk of people, reportedly feel dissatisfied about their jobs. To further explore this, you should read <em>Bullshit Jobs</em> by David Graeber.</p>\n<p>We should reconsider our definition of Hell. If one is forced to do something that one feel no pleasure or happiness in doing, is one in Hell?</p>\n<p>It is common knowledge that different jobs come with different standards of living. There can be some disparity between a person’s choice of occupation and the ideal income for said person.</p>\n<p>This shouldn’t be the case, given that we’ve already come up with so much technology (Green Revolution, industrial automation) such that less people can do more stuff.</p>\n<p>It seems that we’ve come up with a bunch of jobs that don’t necessarily aren’t integral to the world (corporate lawyer comes to mind, not to dismiss them).</p>\n<p>The shift seems rather obvious. It appears that in order to achieve Keynes vision of less work weeks, we need to establish universal basic income. The reason why people do these sort of middle manager jobs is the occupation-income disparity mentioned above. A set UBI would ensure some people to better meet the disparity and should increase global creative output.</p>\n<p>It would also reset the weird passionate people get paid less thing that’s happening. Any highly creative occupation seems to be based off the back of extremely low paid and exploited seekers. Artists, musicians, freelancers, video game programmers, all have their work valued less on average, because “it’s something they want to do”.</p>\n<p>UBI taking money out of the equation, would help satisfy part of level 1 of Maslow’s Pyramid, psychologically satisfying more people, and should help reduce our current mental health crisis.</p>\n<h2>election meddling and political apathy</h2>\n<p>As a person who’s dabbled quite a bit into cybersecurity, I can confidently say that our current infrastructure is woefully inadequate. Anything that is on a computer or “cloud” is liable to get hacked.</p>\n<p>This meddling should serve as a wake-up call for better election security. West Virginia experimented with blockchain-based voting, something that helps tamp down security concerns while also allowing an easier means to address political apathy.</p>\n<p>Political apathy stems from many factors, not all of which I’ll address here. But the political apathy cycle tends to follow a fairly predictable lifetime.</p>\n<p>Problem -> Hope -> Hope Crushed -> Fight back / Be Apathetic</p>\n<p>For the majority of Americans, politics can seem very disconnected from our lives, in the sense that these policies are never read by any of us, and don’t seem to have any direct implications. Occasionally, one comes up that is in our own self-interest. Whether you are for the proposal or against the proposal, it is often the case that the outcome is not what you want, and you are left in a heightened emotional state. You now have two options. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can fight back</li>\n<li>You can accept the results</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This continuously happens until slowly we are divided into extremes. We either have very politically active people or people who have endured enough political foolery that they simply do not care anymore. They choose to distance themselves from an outcome even beforehand, in order to limit any emotional trauma that can come from being invested in the event. This isn’t necessarily bad for your health. But for the state of the nation, especially given that voting is kinda full of friction already, its pretty bad.</p>\n<p>The thing is that whenever things get too terribly bad, it tends to lead previously apathetic people to turn to fighting back. The collision course that it may seem that we are on right now, would seem to lead increased political interest.</p>\n<p>Current voting initiatives and the fact that this generation should be smarter also seem to point to increased voter turnout and political efficacy.</p>\n<h2>Diversity</h2>\n<p>America and the world is getting more diverse. Interracial marriages are more common especially given the strides we’ve made in affordable travel and transit.</p>\n<p>It’s projected that the average American will look much differently in 2050. Now the rest of world is not necessarily like America. The United States is unique in that we seized a bunch of land from some people, kicked them out to small areas of land, and reduced their population until they were a significant minority.</p>\n<p>This means that there is no real native American in the sense that almost everyone in the United States is an immigrant. Some other areas of the world surely share a certain way of living and culture that is promoted through cultural homogeneity.</p>\n<p>I think that UBI and increased global cooperation (especially after our extremist response to our current extremist isolationist position) should enable people to more easily move to different areas, similar to how the EU already works. Changes to economic structure, should reduce economic tensions that run along racial and ethnic lines.</p>\n<h2>Efficiency and Resource Consumption</h2>\n<p>We’ve made continuous strides in artificial intelligence and are now just realizing the potential size and implications that it can have. The most important, at least to me, is in the field of power management. The future is urban, with more and more people choosing to leave suburban sprawl and rural landscapes for more urbanized areas. This has its own advantages and disadvantages for the individuals involved, but it also means that we can project future city growth. This means that given the population density and just concentration of activity, that balanced and efficient power management is a necessity.</p>\n<h2>Increased Choice (or why I do tech)</h2>\n<p>We’ve already seen the new mediums that the Internet has opened up in terms of jobs and income streams. There are more freelancers in developed countries than there were before, given the increased ease. Future technological development should enable people to do jobs that they couldn’t have fathomed doing full-time before.</p>\n<p>It’s in a manner similar to the agricultural revolution. Prior to this, there were no skilled artisans or merchants or blacksmiths or anything like that.</p>\n<p>It was just hunters and gatherers.</p>\n<p>Increased technology should enable people to still do those jobs if they’d like (or as hobbies), but also open new verticals for people who currently cannot afford to do so.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I could just be spewing out a bunch of BS. Why should you trust me, a random guy on the Internet? I don’t know, it’s just how I feel. Use your own discretion.</p>\n<p>NO WARRANTY. I know, I know, but I just have to make this clear. I am not a professional at this in any form or fashion, so my advice should not be used for investing or monetarily related things.</p>\n<p>If you like this sort of stuff, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suchcaptcha\">follow me on Twitter</a>.
