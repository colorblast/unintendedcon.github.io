This seems sensible on the surface level, but it had unintended (con)sequences. The villagers, working towards reaching this metric of snakes killed, actually started breeding snakes in order to reach higher thresholds! This counterintuitive thing is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect\">Cobra effect</a>, but can be broadened into <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart&#x27;s_law\">Goodhart's Law</a>.</p>\n<p>We see this stuff most prominently in our current education system. Our system, through its incentives and grants, imposes a top-down approach that is conducive to one size fits all.</p>\n<p>This is good in certain contexts. In areas where graduation levels are low and career prospects are dim, it is certainly an admirable goal to set standards for these people to work towards.</p>\n<p>For kids with more implicit motivation, who have some idea of what interest them, the whole education system model just completely breaks down.</p>\n<p>The first flaw with schooling is that education removes the implicit motivation that you initially have. You start off questioning everything and being drawn to certain things more than others. You find new things interesting.</p>\n<p>The problem with education is that it's a direct application of Goodhart's law. Most people would agree that the goal of education is to make kids productive members of society, of the greater community.</p>\n<p>The means that the education system uses to do this is grades, through the assignment of a number or letter to indicate how well you did relative to your peers.</p>\n<p>This has a number of implications. If we consider a project or essay that the teacher assigns, this means that any effort that the student may put towards the assignment ultimately gets reduced to one single score. All the hard work and effort doesn't receive any sort of intellectual stimulus or appreciation, any sort of actual thought (for the most part). I've had plenty of experiences where I pour out my heart or work very hard on a project, only for it be thrown back with a random number. Many teachers have complained that because of a standardized approach and time constraints, they're unable to dwell into more exploratory interesting parts of their subject.</p>\n<p>In an effort to quantify, we also lose value. If you haven't watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl8_g72zEUQ\">Allie Brosh's talk</a>, I highly recommend it. People are like a complex set of shapes and zig-zags and who-knows-what. In order to present ourselves in a way that can be fit into time constraints, we reductionize ourselves to caricatures or shapes of who we are. If you still don't get it, think of image compression or audio quality: a JPEG image is a reductionized version of the actual scene; an audio file is similar.</p>\n<p>Now this is a natural process; we convert and represent analog in digital. But given the growing understanding and research being done in cognitive behavior, I'd argue that we're losing out on many people who don't conform or meet these quantified measures. When your implicit motivation to do something is already lost, it's very easy to become apathetic when you hit failure.</p>\n<p>It's also shift-based. Many schools don't offer much in the way of choice when determining and setting a course schedule. If you're interested in doing something (sprint), you may not be able to carry that on to the next semester. If you find your thing, an optimal system should let you drive off on your own course and explore it. Kids shouldn't be forced into a situation where they have to pick between the school course and what they're interested in. The resources should be provided, but classes shouldn't necessarily be mandatory.</p>\n<p>Now that you've already killed off the interest of a decent number of kids, you have to consider the fact that the <strong>education system is set up as a zero sum game</strong>. This system is one of the worst, if not the worst, destroyers of potential.</p>\n<p>Given the breadth of knowledge that the Internet offers, the value of college has increasingly been tied to accreditation.</p>\n<p>Before the Internet age, companies needed to create talent pools. They turned towards colleges to provide this. They needed some sort of way to determine which kids were the best so they outsourced this to universities.</p>\n<p>Universities don't really know the best way to do this either. Some claim they evaluate you 'holistically'. Some claim they rely on the scores from the testing they outsource to the ETS (which makes billions). Some claim they consider circumstance and personality. The whole point of this is the word 'claim'. The whole process is a black-box and not at all transparent and the whole thing probably deserves an overhaul.</p>\n<p>Now that companies outsourced their talent pools to universities, people had to figure out which universities to send their kids to. This meant that there had to be a way to quantify which colleges were the best.</p>\n<p>This led to the creation of things like the U.S. news rankings and college prestige being directly tied to, for better or worse, the acceptance rate (I've been so conditioned that whenever I see a university, I automatically search up its acceptance rate).</p>\n<p>This creates a terrible zero-sum game, which permeates and makes it presence known all the way from the top all the way to the bottom.</p>\n<p>Since there are only so many spots, as colleges limit them, an environment of artificial scarcity is created.</p>\n<p>The result is a hustle culture that starts at really early ages, with more and more of a person's life being predefined (arguably without consent).</p>\n<p>It enforces a regime of toxicity and reduces overall potential. Instead of letting a kid figure out what she likes, a parent can be tempted to put her on a career trajectory that may not be the best fit.</p>\n<p>The solution to this problem is fairly complex. Thinking of alternatives to an instution that has stood the test of time requires mental fortitude.</p>\n<p>The problem is feedback loops. People want to be with people like them. Bubbles occur naturally; there's a really insightful visualization by Nicky Case that illustrates this in terms of diversity.</p>\n<p>We can illustrate this in my personal case.\n'\nWhen I was a college-aspiring student, I originally wanted to go to MIT. I had gone there for a robotics trip and I really liked the fact that MIT funded students to do whatever thing they wanted. I had read the previous history of MIT pulling 'hacks' and doing really cool pranks that were marvels of logistics and engineering.</p>\n<p>Everybody seemed super knowledgeable and I just felt like that would be an environment where I could learn things for the sake of learning. It was more about meeting cool people over the institution.</p>\n<p>The problem is that this is one college with a distinctive name brand and track record. There are, for sure, many colleges, that I've never ever heard of and for which I know almost nothing about.</p>\n<p>Although we wanted places for learning, we reduced it to a single metric, acceptance rate. <strong>Acceptance rate combined with grades, being the measures, makes the original goal of learning cease to exist.</strong></p>\n<p>It is weird in the sense that we actually learn more from the jobs that we take than from the schooling system. The schooling system arguably has one goal: to faciliate the development of individuals to do what they want to do. It absolutely fails at that.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you find this content provocative, you can send me an email or dm me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suchcaptcha\">twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://keybase.io/reallyidk\">keybase</a>.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2020-02-13-when-metrics-replace-the-target"}}}
