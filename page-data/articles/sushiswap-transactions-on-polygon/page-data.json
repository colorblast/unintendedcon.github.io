Today we'll look at how many people have swapped on Sushiswap on both the Ethereum and Polygon mainnets within the past 30 days. We want to see how many transactions they're doing on Polygon, and then look at the gas cost savings from switching from one to the other.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/51127152-2877-4b20-9843-e115d7f8af89/362a4b43-2835-45c7-b49f-20c2a03f1089\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Well, this is unlikely and highly unexpected. Of the 3640 addresses that transacted on Sushiswap on both networks, all of them did a sole transaction. How much gas are they saving? To get this, we'll grab the gas fees associated with each amount and generate a percent, which we'll average out across the network, before comparing.</p>\n<p>Running this query will get us a gas fee percent of .02% for sushi on ethereum and 0.0007% for sushi on matic. On net average, gas fees for transactions on matic sushiswap are 29x cheaper than that on ethereum sushiswap.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"sushiswap-transactions-on-polygon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
