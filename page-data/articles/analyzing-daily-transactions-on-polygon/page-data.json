Refer to these two Twitter threads: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markjeffrey/status/1431151755597803526\">https://twitter.com/markjeffrey/status/1431151755597803526</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RaphaelSignal/status/1430543761361281025\">https://twitter.com/RaphaelSignal/status/1430543761361281025</a> (there was a better twitter thread, but I didnâ€™t bookmark it and twitter search is terrible). The ongoing beef between Andre Cronje (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1426198787010277377\">https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1426198787010277377</a>), banteg, and Polygon founder Mihailo Bjelic has brought this up again.</p>\n<h2>Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>The theory is that Polygon is suffering stagnant growth due to competition from other L2s and sidechains such as Fantom, Avalanche, and Optimism. The original growth was fueled by a couple defi projects followed by an NFT phase. We will seek to validate this hypothesis.</p>\n<h2>Daily Transaction Volume on the Polygon Network</h2>\n<p>The first thing we can do to check this is examine daily transaction volume on Polygon. We will examine it from July 1st.</p>\n<p>We can see a clear spike from early June to late June, which coincides with Sushi launching on the platform. Otherwise, the hypothesis seems to be validated since daily transaction volume seems to be stuck around 4 million with occasional spikes to 6 million.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/5c3c85e2-4c50-4dcd-aaa3-4a5f760c184d/f5f92114-f9f8-4545-aaee-6d54c8b03f1a\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<h2>Distinct Addresses on Polygon</h2>\n<p>Let's look at distinct addresses on the Polygon network. To solve this one, we consider the fact that a udm event usually gets triggered when one creates a new Polygon wallet.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/63ffa77e-729f-4ac5-9022-da16d3684d16/3622ea09-1ebd-436b-a769-fc2da72b409f\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>We can see a nice gradual incline from 1 million unique addresses to 4 million unique addresses. We can compare this to its total incline in unique addresses.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; \" > <iframe src=\"https://velocity-app.flipsidecrypto.com/velocity/visuals/6927ec92-77c5-4950-b0e9-55e6644d1582/aee47982-382c-4683-939a-0f77c050c586\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>We see that from an address standpoint, the amount of addresses on Polygon is growing. Whether this compares relative to other networks like Fantom, would depend on the rates of growth for those networks. Similar to inflation, everything is relative. Additionally, although this data supports Polygon growing, a more accurate metric would probably be daily active users. We did not do any filtering on Polygon as well, so accounts with with trace amounts of MATIC in their wallets were counted in this result.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"analyzing-daily-transactions-on-polygon"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
