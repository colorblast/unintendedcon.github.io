No, I won't sign your NDA.","keywords":["innovation","startups"]},"html":"<p>When I first started building things, I was very hesitant to share them with people. An idea can feel like your own personal thing; I think some people say that you treat it like your child; I'm not entirely sure if that comparison is correct, but it's somewhat along that line of thought.</p>\n<p>The thing is, just by sheer probability, there probably was / is a person who had the same exact idea as you. The odds of you having a truly unique idea that will revolutionize the world is fairly low. </p>\n<p>Ideas also need to be exposed to public discourse in order to determine viability. It's ok if you choose to proceed and ignore what some people say, as long as you go through the process first. You cannot make an informed decision about an idea without some form of exposure to your target audience.</p>\n<p>I, personally, have also found that idea generation is very much like a muscle. Since an early age, I worked my imagination by creating dream worlds for role-playing (and somehow got my brothers to play in them). I read somewhere a while ago that Roald Dahl used to stop whatever he was doing to accept the spontaneity of an idea that comes to him. He would literally be driving, have an idea, stop the car, and pull up a notepad to record that idea. If you have a good idea, you should have a deliberate process for what to do when ideas come to you (I've been recording ideas in Simplenote since early high school). The odds are that if your idea is already really good, you should have no fear if someone else chooses to 'steal' your idea. You should make bets on people, and in this case, you've exercised your idea generation muscles to the point where you should bet on yourself; you have so many good ideas being written down. Competitors 'stealing' your idea also means that some people definitely see the same thing as you, that there's a viable product market fit. If anything, you should thank them. You can copy their marketing strategy; you can look at their best ideas. It creates a competitive synergy where both products should get better / spread further and the world benefits. A crowded market isn't necessarily a problem, but rather an opportunity for you to distinguish yourself (its a win-win game).</p>\n<p>This makes things like NDAs for startups almost completely useless. Markets are expanding, with millions of people demanding better infrastructure, better standards of living, and higher quality of life. The best way for your idea to help address these needs is to expose your idea to the open, to receive feedback, and survive public discourse.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you find this content at all useful, you can send me an email expressing your thanks.
