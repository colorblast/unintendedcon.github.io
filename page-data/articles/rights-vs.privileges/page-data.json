One of the terms I hear most often is 'white privilege'.</p>\n<p>If we arguably look at what government is supposed to do, the original purpose of it was to maintain a monopoly on violence. In order to prevent total anarchy and to ensure activities could happen, all violence was relinquished to the government. In it, we placed hope for justice and retribution should something befall us. In fact, that's what we expected. We could expect to continue normal activities without fear of something happening to us, because we knew if something did, the government would theoretically go after our assailant.</p>\n<p>It is therefore technically our right to life. We use the word privilege everywhere, in reception ceremonies, in weddings, in acceptance speeches, in online discourse. When we accept a speech, we say we don't know how we got it, how we never took it for granted. That's surely one meaning of privilege, to not take anything for granted, to express gratitude. But there's another meaning to the word privilege- that the median is lower than whatever it is you have the privilege of. And that's not right in the context of lives. Everybody should be entitled to have a peaceful and safe existence. Everybody should be able to wear a hoodie or jog without being murdered.</p>\n<p>So instead of getting white people to say that they have the privilege of having a safe peaceful existence, the argument should be that black people have right to life and safety too.</p>\n<p>There's arguably some merit in the term 'check your privilege' when you're referring to some rich dude who spends his summer on his yacht and goes on three vacations every year and whatever. But I think the term has become so pervasive in describing everyday actions. Shaming is useful since it gets to the emotional fast-trigger part of the brain. But I think that in the long term, dialogue that is more constructive in nature, that is more about resolving inequities by bringing people up rather than bringing people down helps the cause more.</p>\n<p>After all, the world isn't zero-sum.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"rights-vs.privileges"}}}
