You have to not only think of an idea, you have to go out and convince people it's a good idea. You have to make sure its the right people too; these people have to have the means to pay or finance whatever you are building. You have to work on marketing/sales, developing your product, iteration, and clearing regulatory hurdles. There's a bunch of legal paperwork; there's grant-writing; there's a whole host of things that you have to deal with.</p>\n<p>As a person with a relatively decent background, having surrounded myself in a setting where the innovation levels are high (Bram Cohen and Naval Ravikant are alumni of my high school), I can attest that the process of building something out is still hard.</p>\n<p>There's a landmark <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w24062\">study</a> conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research that examined which people in America become inventors and what factors contributed to these people following that path.</p>\n<p>Bell, Chetty, et al. found that the most important factors were income, race, and gender. If you are in the top 1%, your child is 10 times more likely to become an inventor than a child from a family with below-median income (median income in America is 63,179 as I write this). A white person is 3x more likely to become an inventor than a black person. And most concerningly, only 18% of inventors are women (rhode island is best at mitigating this).</p>\n<p>In terms of environment, innovation is concentrated in the Northeastern United States (massachusetts, rhode island, new york), coastal california, upper colorado, and parts of the midwest (Wisconsin, Michigan).</p>\n<p>Bell, Chetty, et al. then go on to prove that talent is distributed in a geographically flat fashion, with people who weren't in commuting zones with high levels of innovation suffering from lack of opportunity.</p>\n<h2>resources for dealing with this</h2>\n<p>If you're a young person looking to become a technologist / inventor, there's a bunch of resources out there that can try to help make up for these hurdles. I'm a subscriber to the belief that you are mostly a product of your environment.</p>\n<h3>teenage years (13-18)</h3>\n<p>If you're a teen / still in high school, look at <a href=\"https://theksociety.com\">The Knowledge Society</a>. Programs like the knowledge society are based in commuting zones with much higher innovation indexes and can open new opportunities. Things like John Hopkin's <a href=\"https://cty.jhu.edu\">CTY</a> and <a href=\"https://sparc-camp.org\">SPARC</a> provide summer programs and enrichment. MIT also has a program called <a href=\"https://launchx.com\">launchx</a> that can help you if you're looking into starting a business.</p>\n<p>If you have no idea where to start, and it seems like I'm coming fast at you, try attending hackathons. Hackathons are spreading everywhere now; you can find a directory of them on <a href=\"https://mlh.io\">MLH</a>. If you're in California, YCombinator hosts a <a href=\"https://blog.ycombinator.com/apply-to-the-yc-fall-hackathon-2019/\">yearly hackathon</a>; <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2020/\">Disrupt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sxsw.com/conference/sxsw-hackathon/\">SXSW</a>, and <a href=\"https://daremightythings.co\">Dare Mighty Things</a> also host hackathons.</p>\n<p>If you find that you cannot afford / don't have the means to travel to conferences / big profile hackathons (I think most of the hackathons are free, but traveling can be an issue) then I'd suggest hanging out at places like your local startup incubator / accelerator and attending more local hackathons, like local hack day. Attending meetups in your chosen field can work too; I've done this in New York and learned a whole bunch of things. People may shoot you an odd look and it's weird socializing when like everyone is drinking, but you can learn alot of stuff (I got to hear John Langford, the founder of Microsoft Research in NY!).</p>\n<p>Understand that innovation can often involve a decent amount of periods of solitude. It can be harder for people to comprehend the things that you say, and you should understand that this is completely normal.</p>\n<p>The Internet has alot of great content, but there's also a ton of attention-grabby stuff that is meant purely for that dopamine rush (brief enjoyment) so if you're looking for more high quality content, I recommend reading a ton of books. You're reading this to look to become an innovator, so I would recommend reading books that deal with how founders got initially started. There's a large number of self-help and business books that are completely bullshit or have a good premise, but have useless walls of text before the premise is reached so I don't particularly recommend them. Podcasts are super useful; I recommend <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast\">Indie Hackers</a>, <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/welcome-to-the-deepmind-podcast\">the Deepmind podcast</a>, <a href=\"https://twimlai.com\">TWIML</a>, and <a href=\"https://lexfridman.com/ai/\">Lex Friedman's Podcast</a>. Don't worry if you don't understand most of the stuff; I'm finding it increasingly the case where most 'adults' don't really understand quite what they're doing. Just let it soak in.</p>\n<p>Be highly open to anything, but understand that your time is extremely important and that you should know when to say no to things. Don't be risk averse (you are at an age where you can do riskier stuff than usual), but understand that you have to be picky.</p>\n<p>Try to think more abstractly, looking for patterns in things. Our world is moving towards a more globally integrated place, and it will value people who can better piece together big picture concepts.</p>\n<p>Find a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/36579366\">guiding principle</a>; mine is increasing choice.</p>\n<p>MOOCs are upending higher education; just pick one if you can't figure out which one you want.</p>\n<p>Use your position as a student as an advantage; people who consider themselves 'adults' tend to see themselves in you.</p>\n<p>Look into assessing your personality so you can get a better sense of what your weaknesses are. My weaknesses are being super narrow-focused on my goals and being anti-social (I have <a href=\"https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/social-anxiety-disorder-more-than-just-shyness/index.shtml\">SAD</a>).</p>\n<p>Things like debt and economic insecurity can harm your potential for innovation. Look into Maslow's pyramids of needs, and work towards addressing each level.</p>\n<h3>university years</h3>\n<p>I'm still in university, so I'm still working on this lol. There's an awesome list by <a href=\"https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/\">Alexey Guzey</a> that links to so many different resources, ideas, and opportunities.</p>\n<p>If you have an idea, and you find your university / community incubator to be too bureaucratic, you should consider applying to <a href=\"https://pioneer.app/join/unintendedcon\">Pioneer</a>(this is a referral link) or <a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/emergentventures\">Emergent Ventures</a>. You can look at advice from <a href=\"https://patrickcollison.com/advice\">Patrick Collison</a> for more on this and how to develop as a person. Collison, if you're not aware, is the guy from Ireland who founded Stripe.</p>\n<p>There are also summer startup fellowships run by <a href=\"https://trueventures.com/true-platform/fellowships/tec\">True Entrepreneur Corps</a> and <a href=\"https://joininteract.com/fellowship/\">Interact</a>. There's a whole list of <a href=\"https://github.com/nayafia/microgrants\">microgrants</a> out there.</p>\n<p>Arvid Kahl has a really good guide on the whole process of starting a business <a href=\"https://thebootstrappedfounder.com/zero-to-sold/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you're looking at doing stuff with AI, <a href=\"https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/\">Andrej Karpathy's blog</a> and <a href=\"https://colah.github.io\">Christopher Olah's blog</a> are good starting points. <a href=\"https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/\">Chistopher Molnar</a> hosts a book on Interpretable ML.</p>\n<p>There's alot of people who will try to convince you that you need them in order to get something done. Be selective about who you choose to work with, and don't rush into complicated legal agreements without first considering whether incentives are aligned at all, and if so, how strongly aligned they are.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unintendedcon.github.io/articles/2020-02-07-luck-is-a-numbers-game\">Rejection is the norm</a>.</p>\n<p>Work on being an active communicator and sharing your knowledge.</p>\n<h3>post-university</h3>\n<p>Haven't gotten to this point yet. Give me a couple of years.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you feel this content is helpful in any sort of way, you can send me a simple email telling me you appreciate it.
