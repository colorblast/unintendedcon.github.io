Failure is an option.","keywords":["innovation","transparency","failure"]},"html":"<p>I was recently looking at case studies of technology companies and I stumbled upon a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5146&#x26;v=YJx-cU9CKLI&#x26;feature=emb_logo\">video</a> from the Stanford McCoy Family Center on Ethics in Society.</p>\n<p>The video examined the Theranos incident from the perspective of the two whistleblowers, from the absolute beginning where they were recruited to Theranos to the aftermath.</p>\n<p>The two whistleblowers, Tyler Schultz and Erika Chung, were both recent grads at the time they joined Theranos.</p>\n<p>They had multiple offers, but the allure of doing something that would revolutionize biotech and blood testing drove them to Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos.</p>\n<p>It became readily apparent that something was wrong there, where employees were often shielded from seeing the actual devices. Sunny Balwani enforced strict and long working hours and people threw any data that didn't support their conclusions out.</p>\n<p>When they realized this and chose to leak this to the press, they were followed, with Theranos hiring private investigators to stalk them.</p>\n<h2>Moral of the story</h2>\n<p>The thing is, I'd like to think that Elizabeth Holmes didn't start out with bad intentions.</p>\n<p>As noted in an earlier <a href=\"https://unintendedcon.github.io/articles/2020-02-08-flattening-the-innovation-opportunity-gap\">post</a> about the innovation gap, the percentage of women inventors is only 18%. Blood testing and healthcare in this country are grossly mismanaged and just messed up in terms of price and affordability. It's easy to envision her trying to follow her idol, Steve Jobs, and just being caught up in this founder vision where she legitimately believed that she was doing something good.</p>\n<p>Founder vision, like all things, has its tradeoffs. On one hand, you kinda need founder vision in order to realize what you're creating. It provides the implicit motivation that you can and you will make the world better, or disrupt whatever industry you're looking at.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you can have a scenario like Theranos. I have no doubt that Elizabeth Holmes, feeling the pressure of being the first significant woman inventor, felt the burden of failure weigh more heavily than most. Her success would undoubtedly inspire generations of female inventors, disrupt the biotech industry, and leave her name in the history books.</p>\n<p>The problem with Theranos is this inability to accept failure. Progress has been shown time and time again to be non-linear, with certain times to have great spurts, and other times to be more middling. There are times when progress can feel like its moving backwards. As much as I can understand Holmes given her position, it doesn't excuse the fact that she didn't take the time to step back, realize what she was doing, what it's consequences were, and how that would impact millions of Americans.</p>\n<p>It got to the point where the company she ran, Theranos, hired these investigators to follow said whistleblowers. The goal of technology is to make the world a better place, and one should take a good deal of time to examine the facts objectively, from <em>tabula rasa</em>, instead of getting caught up in the moment and self-rationalizing every single action made.</p>\n<p>Constant communication and transparency with all stakeholders should happen, in order to prevent incidents like this from ever happening again.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>If you find this content useful, even in the slightest, I'd appreciate it if you sent an email expressing this.
