When the task is something like answering a set of questions, it feels much easier to start because the problem spec is well-defined. I can easily see the linearity of my progress-- I got question 1, 2, and 4 done.</p>\n<p>This is not the case for things like essays or content creation. The assignment doesn't have an exact linearity, making the creation of said thing much more hit or miss. If I'm feeling it, I can write what I believe to be a somewhat decent essay, but there are many other times where this is not the case. It's much more sporadic, wherein I get a boost of energy or adrenaline. When I get this energy, I need to work on the the thing I'm thinking about immediately, lest it fade away. The work either gets done or it doesnâ€™t.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"on-linearity"}}}
