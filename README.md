# unintendedcon

This is based off Taylor Bryant's [Gatsby+Tailwind starter](https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind). It also uses epilande's [gatsby-theme-gallery](https://github.com/epilande/gatsby-theme-gallery).

The stack behind this blog is Figma, Gatsby, Tailwindcss, React, postcss, purgecss, and Cheerio.

It fully supports a relatively minimalistic website with a blog, photo gallery, and SEO.
