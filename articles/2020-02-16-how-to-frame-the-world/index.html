<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">tldr: our representations suck, but we&apos;re working on making them better and I&apos;m optimistic.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This post is a response to memetic theory. As provocative and interesting as it sounds, I&apos;m a fundamentally optimistic person who shares a different worldview. If you&apos;re not sure what memetic theory is, it is the theory that humans, regardless of age, are highly immitative of each other. Since we&apos;re tribalistic, we have to find someone or something to be the other. Whenever anyone breaks the code of the tribe, regardless of who you are or what you&apos;ve done, the tribe will sacrifice you.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">That&apos;s super grim and as much as I entertained the notion, I like my theory better. My theory is that the world is complex, our lifespan is limited, and that every single communication / action is fundamentally a tradeoff. The way we are achieving progress is by broadening the choice of actions for future generations. Argument happens because we have limited representations of what are, in actuality, complex spaces. We have not achieved the understanding that we quite seek, but we are working to get there.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">things are complicated</h2>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">I struggled with depression a couple of years ago. The act of waking up and proceeding with the day felt like torture and I couldn&apos;t really feel anything. I didn&apos;t feel like I had anyone to rant to.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">One thing that made me feel better about my depression was discovering Allie Brosh&apos;s web-comic <a href="https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900"><em class="italics">Hyperbole and a Half</em></a>. The comics are super funny, not just for the wholesomeness (and meme material), but also the relatability and accurate depiction of depression. Brosh dropped out of the public sphere a couple of years ago, and so when looking for more material, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl8_g72zEUQ" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">this talk</a> by her on this JoCo Cruise.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">In the talk, Brosh states how we often represent ourselves as reductionized forms of ourselves, say a triangle. She then draws a bunch of zig-zags and swirls and things that this language cannot really represent or define, over that triangle, to represent what a human is.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">It&apos;s a known problem that linguistics has its limitations. If you&apos;re a bilingual speaker, there&apos;s a high chance that you&apos;ve had an experience where there&apos;s a concept in one language for which there is not quite a direct translation in the other.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">It&apos;s also a known fact that human life is finite. We value our own time. The way how we express this is through machine-like indifference and efficiency. Every person has some self-interest involved. Sometimes self-interests can align. But ultimately, everyone is interested in something that provides value to themselves or enhances their own lives. We can see how this self-interest reflects in how we communicate.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Unless we have immense familiarity (or no familiarity at all but the interaction is a chance no-stakes occurrence) with the person at hand, we reductionize ourselves to whatever category society applies to us. For the majority of us, we derive our value from gainful employment; we associate ourselves with the labels of &apos;lawyer&apos;, &apos;banker&apos;, &apos;teacher&apos;, &apos;social worker&apos;, etc. Human life is finite, and there is a high chance that if you and the other person don&apos;t really care about the interaction, that this imperfect reductionized fib is fine.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">analog world</h2>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Everything in the world is analog, yet for us to make any meaning out of it, we have to create digital versions of them. Any CS student is familiar with the fact that floating point numbers cannot quite be represented by a computer. It is, at best, an estimate.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Audiophiles no doubt, have noticed a difference between listening to a digital recording of music on a service like Spotify vs. attending a live music concert. Photographers have noticed the difference between the actual observance of a thing vs the photograph of it.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The world, in a sense, can only be understood by us compressing this analog information into imperfect digital information. Although this information is imperfect, its usable information. Here&apos;s a somewhat decent analogy: think of a human as a computer with only so much space. Since we have so many interactions, by nature, we have to compress a bunch of these files in order to retain their memories.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We create digital categories for how we represent information. We apply heuristics and pattern-matching to determine what a chair is. In biology, we apply taxonomy to create classes of animals. In education, we come up with different mental models of students. In politics, we have different tents and umbrellas for different ideologies.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">trust</h2>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We have limited lifespan which by induction, means that we have limited experience. Thus, our understanding of our world is capped by our lives. In order for us to make decisions and just be the social species that we are, we have to form trust. We have to determine exactly what sort of people and information is trustworthy. For many people, this means people that are like them and content that matches their belief patterns. Given that kids are very much influenced by their parents (which I think Girard overbroadens to the whole of society) and the fact that people seek people like them, it is highly likely that everyone will form this bubble or echo chamber. For more on this, you can see Nicky Case&apos;s (and Vi Hart&apos;s) <a href="https://ncase.me/polygons/" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">Parable of the Polygons</a>.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">our models for understanding suck</h2>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">geography</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">One of the best examples of this is our mapping systems. Explorers and traders needed to figure out where they were going, and to do that, they needed a model of where everything was. The limitation, of course, was that the only material available for this was paper, which is two-dimensional. Given the world is circular and 3-dimensional, the challenge of representing our world in 2-d without significant distortions was a huge challenge.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This was something that afflicted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection#Distortion_of_sizes" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">Mercator Projection</a>, where certain countries were distorted far further (looking at you Greenland!). We&apos;ve tried to account for this with the Robinson Projection, but it&apos;s still imperfect.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">science</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">To understand things, in science, we most commonly use models. There are many interactions, so we rely on things like environmental models to emulate the interactions between things like the sun, our atmosphere, the clouds, and plants.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The problem with science is that in science we tend to look towards proving a hypothesis. We are trying to prove that something has a significant effect on something else.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This is actually quite hard to do. There are standards of thresholds that have been normalized in different fields of study, but it is fairly easy to get around them, through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">p-hacking and other statistical tricks</a>. Who exactly gets to define what an outlier is, or what a correlation is, is left to the study author.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This is further compounded by the various systemic incentives in science. The push in science is supposedly to discover truth, but the metric used for such a thing is papers published. We get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">Goodhart&apos;s law</a> all over again, where the metric replaces the target, making the target useless.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Given that science, like many other academic fields, has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/04/bad-job-market-phds/479205/" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">become over-saturated</a> with PhDs and postdocs, I have no doubt that liberties are taken in the pursuit of papers and citations. As Katz would advise, if you like science, <a href="http://katz.fastmail.us/scientist.html" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">don&apos;t become a scientist.</a></p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We can see this push to publish cause significant fraud, as has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-research-papers-raise-doubts-fueling-global-questions-about-scientific-integrity-11593939600" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">documented</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/13/world/asia/china-science-fraud-scandals.html" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">in</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00439-9" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">China</a>.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">When we also see the fact that there is little to no replication studies being done, with some journals even denying funding for such studies, the cynicism can really start to spread.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The result is that there are so many &quot;experts&quot; and studies out there, enough that one can cherry-pick their favorite views.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">politics</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">In politics, the most common representation of how voters are aligned is a spectrum. It goes from left to right, with supposedly different levels of an ideology representing where you were on the spectrum. The problem, as clearly shown in 2016, is that this is an oversimplification. Many people who had previously voted for Obama voted for Trump in 2016. What gives?</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The spectrum is an inaccurate digital model of an analog phenomenon. It fails to account for edge contingencies like someone who has strongly held views that are spread fairly even across the entire spectrum. A person could have strong feelings about small government (a traditional conservative platform), but support all the social platforms and ideas that are traditionally associated with liberalism.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">It fails to account for voter apathy or for people who simply don&apos;t like any of the provided ideologies.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">In the creation of the spectrum, much like the compression of an image from a physical setting, value is lost, and some of it is critical.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We can see this reflected in how politicians appeal to us. Instead of focusing on policy and what they&apos;re willing to do for us, they appeal to our emotions and say that the other side is worse instead of trying to be better.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">anchoring and needles in a haystack</h2>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">In order to determine the value of something, we need to anchor it to some value. You can see this most blatantly in the form of super market ads, where they may have products at inflated prices with steep discounts and say they&apos;re &quot;on sale&quot;. Your mind determines that this price is the &quot;real value&quot; of the item and that you are getting a discount, so this must be a good deal.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We use anchoring in many other ways. I&apos;m most interested in anchoring and its effects on social interaction and quality of life.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Consider this. Before the Enlightenment, who was spouting off about rights? No one had rights to literally anything. Everything was considered a privilege. Only by achieving some form of consensus, were they able to agree that everyone had some actions and abilities that could not be taken away or violated. In this sense, they created a higher baseline, they anchored the rights of individuals at a certain point.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">What makes this all a stroke of genius is that we&apos;ve turned this into literal religion. We set a hard fence, saying the buck stops here, we will not surpass this point. We mythologized this into a document that we can pretty much never amend or change, enshrining it not just into our nation&apos;s history, but into it&apos;s ethos.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Now consider social media. Real life social interaction is anchored by some sense of politeness or respect for whoever you&apos;re talking to. The person you&apos;re talking to is literally in front of you, and so you can more easily visualize what sort of effect something you might say might have on said person. You can more easily read that person&apos;s responses. You are also more accountable for what you say. If you&apos;re not in a group interaction, you are more likely to engage in a more serious attempt at discourse, and even if you are in a group, chances are that this group is less polarized that whatever internet clique you associate yourself with. There are still mechanisms that ensure this baseline.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The baseline for social media is absolutely terrible. The only thing required is the ability to spur on some form of emotion. The friction involved in doing such low-effort posts or dumping is much less than some form of thoughtful interaction. Furthermore, as we are more naturally inclined to react or make decisions based off emotion rather than reason, we are already biased towards this form of emotional manipulation.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Some may argue that the answer for this is moderation, but this is ignorant of the fact that at scale, weird things happen. Large public squares like Facebook are larger than governments and don&apos;t have the centralized consensus that the founders had when they agreed on a set of rights. They are more likely to be eclipsed by a platform that does not require something like that, as we are seeing in terms on the global level with the United States and China. The United States offers economic aid, but with strings attached. Human rights records need to be improved. X and Y condition have to be met. China has much less strings. And thus, we come to the conclusion that anchoring or the baseline is set by the weakest point. If some country is willing to use child labor to churn out fast fashion, it sets the bar for everyone else in a very sad race to the bottom.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The way around this bar-setting is branding. Branding ignores the baseline because it creates an individualistic independent identity for itself. You get a sense of what the company believes or stands for.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">A more important question in terms of the baseline is our deficits, which will be explored in much more detail in the truly liquid markets section.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">bad actors</h2>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">media</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The media is an elitist institution and has been that way for the past couple centuries. Noam Chomsky explores how media serves as the vanguard of any movement, how it gets to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">define what is acceptable discourse</a>, what isn&apos;t acceptable discourse, and what exactly is news-worthy.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The problem with media is again it&apos;s incentives. For-profit media has two business models right now: ads and subscription.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The first is incentivized to get as many clicks as possible on a given article. They also give up a decent amount of creative control to the advertisers as the advertisers are paying for the newspaper to continue to function. This kills reader-alignment and makes it much harder to create content that appeals to both the reader and advertiser. In the end, you often get generic articles that don&apos;t really say much about anything.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The second is better aligned with it&apos;s readership. But this itself is a problem. Media and news is a product. The news produced by a particular organization must meet and match the worldview of it&apos;s audience. For the New York Times or the Atlantic, that&apos;s wealthy coastal liberals. For Vox, it&apos;s coastal millennials. For the WSJ, it&apos;s coastal conservative finance types.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">If you paid attention, you&apos;ll notice that the majority of these publications are coastal. In fact, almost all media is headquartered in New York. The decline of the local paper, as they <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/148022/finance-killing-news" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">get bought by private equity firms</a>, has resulted in a disproportionate focus on what the people who read the NYT, the Atlantic, or the WSJ are interested in. Although I cannot confirm this, national news often seems to trigger emotions more.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Now we can see how exactly this defines what truth is told. There are two models for how this unfolding. One involves social media and one involves journalistic monopoly.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The journalistic monopoly form is that ideological outlets or fringe outlets will publish views that align with theirs. Some may be true, some may not be, it all depends on the outlet&apos;s standards. The news stories eventually is read by some person at a more mainstream place like the Times (The Times is just being used as an example, don&apos;t take this personally), and some combination of people decide whether they want to air the story. The other outlets, such as Vice, U.S. News, and the New Yorker then will follow and also air the story (may not necessarily be those outlets, consider this an abstract thinking experiment). Thus, consensus is achieved. This gives enormous power to the &quot;lead&quot; organizations such as the Times, because they ultimately determine what exactly becomes the story or the narrative.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">As much as journalists claim that they seek the truth and objectivity, journalism has become a product so this monopoly does not satisfy everyone. In the age of social media, we see sites spring up to meet literally every ideological view or way of thinking. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter significantly reduced the friction involved in sharing information, especially emotionally-charged information. This has made it easy for things like fake news to proliferate. It has also created a toxic atmosphere where everyone is so emotionally-charged. This has had real-world effects in the keyboard warrior phenomenon. People are abstracted from the results of their actions and are increasingly not seeking to engage with people they disagree with, but perform and mock said person in front of their audience.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Journalism has fallen by the sword of postmodernism whereby they&apos;ve deconstructed literally everything that the only way forward is nihilism. Institutions deserve a check and should require accountability, but ironically the people who are supposed to hold them accountable, journalists, often don&apos;t hold themselves accountable. Fredrik De Boer had an excellent post on this (which he later deleted) called the irresistible force vs. the ironized object. When the media refuses to engage with it&apos;s critics, and instead labels them as Big [whatever] (which can be true, but doesn&apos;t necessarily engage with said criticism), it only increases the number of people who feel alienated by the surrounding media apparatus.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This alienation has led to a significant change in the media landscape that is still on-going. We are seeing figures like Joe Rogan fill the gap left by the current media landscape. Podcasting is increasing, newsletters are increasing, decentralized individual media apparatuses are growing. In forming an exclusive media tribe that will only engage on specific stories, that portion of the media becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This was not the case 20 or 30 years ago with cable. When you have only a couple TV channels vs a whole Internet of every view conceivable, you don&apos;t have much of a choice in terms of where you&apos;re sourcing your information from.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Anyways, this news as a product thing clearly has it&apos;s flaws. If it&apos;s not outright choosing what truth to pick or rank, it may distort it to fit it&apos;s narrative.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The solution I have towards this is probably something along the lines of just getting rid of for-profit national media altogether. Non-profit outlets like ProPublica do a much better job of reporting anyways. They get national stories by threading local stories together. Something like NPR also does fine.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The concern here is of course, centralization, and the government. If we let the government control the media, are we not enabling straight-up propaganda? Media clearly needs to be supported so who funds it? This is a good reason for Universal Basic Income (UBI), but I digress. We don&apos;t necessarily have to have the government fund it, if we as individuals are empowered to do so.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">tribalism</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Tribalism and ideological groups are a large reason why our models for understanding suck. Groups don&apos;t particularly care about the truth (we can define the truth as some arbitrary linear combination of things that make the world work). They care about examining the entirety of the world through their lens and convincing you that this view is the correct one.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Tribalism is hard to dispel because it has it&apos;s benefits. For one, it fosters a sense of community. If everyone in your community share the habit of going to the movies on a particular day, it becomes an exclusive community. Given that there is good reason to believe that our identities are formed not by our similarities, but by our differences, this gives us something to distinguish ourselves by forming an out-group.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">A common phenomenon in the social platforms and communities that have been formed on the Internet is that the community tends to be small and tight-knit, but as the platform grows or acquires some large number of users, the advantages of said community falls apart and the original users leave. The result is that platform is a shell of itself.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We&apos;ve always had tribalism, but it&apos;s grown worse in the age of the Internet. The internet has created gigantic platforms full of plenty of users, some of whom are definitely going to be bad actors.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">As the number of people on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter eclipse the population of governments, there have been growing calls for Facebook and Twitter to enforce stricter moderation. We&apos;ll get back to this when we discuss anchoring and why it&apos;s not possible for them do this.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Tribalism ensures that people do not deviate from the consensus viewpoint, regardless of it&apos;s validity. I find it hard to believe that in this time period that we&apos;ve gotten everything right. The probability exists, but I find it shockingly low. If the consensus just a couple decades ago was that gay people should go f*ck themselves, I think there&apos;s definitely some stuff wrong with societal consensus right now.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">With the Internet, consensus doesn&apos;t even necessarily have to be the majority, but rather a small vocal and influential plurality. As long as social media sets the baseline of quality of conversation as super low, arguments and ideas will continually be misrepresented in favor of whatever narrative or agenda the group is pushing.</p>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">incumbency</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Capitalism is not inherently bad. There needs to be some level of inequality in order to create a system that has fluidity and the chance of promotion. Capitalism, when under a truly free market, should &quot;grow the pie&quot;, that is create technological progress that raises the standards of living for all people. The problem is that this progress has been largely captured by the ones creating it, and is not spreading to the rest of the population. This has not increased quality of living, but decreased it (in America). More of this to come in the truly liquid market section.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The problem is that this system has created a very narrow set of &apos;winners&apos;, incumbents that don&apos;t really have to do much in order to stay incumbents. With the wealth gap seriously widening, at some point, too much inequality leads to revolution and the tearing down of the whole apparatus.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The problem of incumbency also lies with any sort of organization that is meant to solve a problem. An organization that is dedicated towards fighting and eliminating cancer is ironically incentivized to not eliminate it. If cancer were gone, the organization would have to dissolve or shift it&apos;s focus to another issue. Funding could dry up. It wouldn&apos;t be stable. The safest move is to play it the subscription way, saying that the problem is getting bigger and bigger, and continually milking funders for more and more resources. As bigger organizations are seen as a source of pride for managers (&quot;I have 30 people under me!&quot;), the result is eventually some bloated ineffective mess. Whereas an organization may have been super effective upon it&apos;s founding, we see that it follows some form of asymptotic lifetime, such that eventually it does more harm than good.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Incumbent monopolies are an issue in the sense that they do not have any underlying incentive to innovate or change. They have no sense of competition to drive them away from the path of least resistance: charging more and more for the same product, milking as much as possible similar to how private equity works. Just like how prolonged competition results in cost-cutting and decrease in product quality, non-existent competition also results in inferior products. The products that are created have to meet certain standards of compliance or a certain market share in order for the company to consider them. The company&apos;s outlook and goals restrict and restrain what can be produced.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">a truly liquid market</h2>
<h3 class="text-2xl mt-8">the shroud of our deficits</h3>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">I don&apos;t think people quite realize this, but the market is not &quot;free&quot; if there are no regulations in place. Let&apos;s examine why.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">For one, humans are notoriously deficit. We need food, water, and shelter on a consistent basis. If we want certain thresholds of living, this also means things like electricity, Internet, healthcare, energy, and other necessities.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Note the word necessities. The demand for these things, as far as I know, will always exist. They form the core building blocks of our society.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">This means that a truly free market cannot quite exactly deal with this sort of thing. In a &quot;free&quot; market, hypothetically people will act &quot;rationally&quot; and will do what&apos;s in their best interest. If something is a rip-off, then the person will not buy it. If the job doesn&apos;t pay enough money, the person will not take it. If the job has severe injury risk, compensation should increase.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">If we visualize the demand as a graph, however, we can see that these things are not negotiable, and even if they are, we really shouldn&apos;t have it so. Should someone starve themselves in order to keep money for healthcare? Should someone be evicted to maintain groceries on the table?</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Regardless of however much is charged, the demand will continue to exist. This creates an environment of scarcity and a culture of safetyism.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">In &apos;Transcend&apos;, Scott Barry Kaufman documents this effect as having a boat, but never setting sail. You&apos;re too consumed with making sure you don&apos;t drown so you don&apos;t end up exploring what&apos;s possible.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">A free-market proponent might counter that certainly some company or organization would come up to provide these things at more affordable costs. This should eventually drive down the prices of everybody else.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">There are numerous counters to that. The two obvious ones are monopoly and coordination. Monopolies are entrenched incumbents. They have so much power, that in an environment of either too little regulation or too much regulation, will stomp out everyone else. The other is coordination. If some countries form an oil cartel like OPEC did, then they can maintain control over the prices while demand stays the same.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The other is that these things are resource-based and have an operating price floor for how much a company can charge for it. Companies can make all the optimizations and subsidies that they want, but the end result in the long term is something that requires a fixed profit.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">It&apos;s well documented how people in war zones suffer terribly. Quality of life is down. Time to think about abstractions is pretty much non-existent because you&apos;re never given a time to breathe. You have to worry about survival. You cannot focus on understanding or growth or progress when there&apos;s gunfire happening outside. While these deficits don&apos;t immediately create an environment of terror, they create a system which leads to one, to our society&apos;s detriment.</p>

<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Why can&apos;t these people just make more money? Why should I have to pay to fund some sort of social safety net so these people can mooch off these hard-earned tax dollars?</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Given that the population is super-large, there are bound to be bad actors. Just considering a random distribution of people, skill-sets, and personalities, there will be people with little to no utility. However, when we look at the <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2017/05/24/what-happens-when-states-go-hunting-for-welfare-fraud" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">statistics</a>, welfare fraud is only around 5% (Pew Research Center). Given that inequality has followed power laws and broadened to the point where the first percentile income class has greater wealth than the bottom ninety-nine, it&apos;d seem to make sense. Arguably, the easiest way to get rid of the fraud is to get rid of mean-testing (UBI), but I digress.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">We need to consider what exactly is money. Is money some physical thing that we want in it of itself? Or is it something that functions as proxy for the things that we want?</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Outside of a small subset of people who are dedicated to collecting money solely because they&apos;re obsessive about it, the majority of people are using it as a proxy.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Who exactly issues money? As of now, governments. Non-profit foundations are doing stuff with crypto, but governments largely have kept their money monopoly.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">What prevents a government from issuing as much money as it wants to solve these deficits? Why can&apos;t they turn the money printer on and make it go brrr? There are three reasons: unequal distribution, outside entities, and markets.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">Unequal distribution is easy. As currency inflation is uniform, the people who are not the beneficiaries of the unequal distribution, will be left with currency that is valued less. It&apos;s classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_dilution" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">stock dilution</a>.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">If the money is printed by the government to pay it&apos;s debts, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe" class="text-gray-700 font-bold underline hover:text-gray-900">Zimbabwe did</a>, it lowers the credit rating for the currency and causes inflation. Since the world is pretty global and interdependent, this means that relative to other currencies, Zimbabwe&apos;s dollar loses value. This can be solved by a one centralized currency for the entirety of a system. Like a search engine, or like electricity, money may need to be viewed in the future as a utility. We explore this more in the case for utilities.</p>
<p class="leading-loose text-lg text-gray-800 mt-8">The last concern is that of demand and supply. If the amount of people who want something is greater than the amount of that item, there is no possible way to satisfy all of them. I argue in the next section, that we have the capacity and resources to make this happen. The mindset of scarcity should not exist when we have the world into one of abundance.</p>
