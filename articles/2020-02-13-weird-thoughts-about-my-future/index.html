<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">All the signs pointed towards me doing some founder and startup thing now that I think about it.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">reading</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Since an early age, I&apos;ve read a ton. I was initially really bad at it, but I got good at it and began to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">By some time, I was reading so much, that my mom enforced this rule that if I had to read an autobiography for every fiction book that I wanted to read.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">That didn&apos;t reduce my pace, and I ended up getting further restricted towards pure autobiographies. As my local library is rather small, I started picking books that were increasingly larger.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Most of the books were business people who wrote these books to gloat about their accomplishments rather than provide actual advice about how they got to where they were. But occasionally, you&apos;d run into a book that provided a much more detailed account than normal.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">personality</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Throughout most of my life, I&apos;ve felt disconnected with people. Psychology explains how there are different social situations that require different social pattern matching, in order to maintain and have a good interaction.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Daniel Kahneman goes into more detail about how we have two &apos;systems&apos; (this is a misnomer, but a decent approximation) of psychological thought. The first is fast, more immediate, and deals with our day to day interactions. It includes things like talking, memorization, and other things for which we have fast recall. It&apos;s neccesary for us to exist in society.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">The second system is one that is more deliberate and slow. It tends to be more logical. People tend to tell me that I pick my words very carefully. It needs more time to think about things in order to better understand and formulate a response.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">The result is that I ended up being this weird socially anxious kid who just existed on the periphery of things.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">openness</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I don&apos;t rule anything out. This really increased in high school. In senior year, I had some periods for electives. I wanted to take something interesting like human geography or geopolitics. If not, graphic design (useful skill) would do just fine. The elective thing was a ranked choice system though, so I added this class, WPT (western political thought), as an afterthought. I don&apos;t like terms like &apos;western&apos; or &apos;eastern&apos; because the terminology implies this false, extremely broad grouping (you can infer my distaste for the political terms &apos;left&apos; and &apos;right&apos;).</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I had already been somewhat open, having done some debate (and being legitimately terrible at it), but I found Socrates to be extremely useful.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">In one dialogue, he explains how it&apos;s impossible to tell what is 100% real. How do we know we exist? How do we know that our human perception is correct?</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">The one thing that we do know is that we don&apos;t know anything. And from there, you can start to build a foundation towards understanding the world better.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">This informs my perspective because it means that since you don&apos;t know anything, you shouldn&apos;t dismiss people and opportunities. It means that if someone offers a contradicting perspective, you say huh, take it seriously into account, weigh the evidence, have respectful debate, admit what you do and do not know, and politefully agree to disagree if the ideas don&apos;t line up.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I&apos;ve had legitimately cool experiences by being open to them. When I rsvped to some event in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, I got to hear Adam Cheyer up close about how initially pitched Siri to investors. I attended a papers we love meeting, despite having no idea what the paper was about, and having almost no knowledge of machine learning. I got to hear the godfather of reinforcement learning, John Langford, the creator of contextual bandits himself, give a shortened version of his ICML talk.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">When my flight got delayed and eventually cancelled, I didn&apos;t mope around. I actually met the lawyer who headed Obama&apos;s aunt&apos;s political asylum case in a Detroit metrocab at 2am in the morning.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">subverting systems (thinking out of the box)</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I was somewhat late to the technology game. I got a phone relatively late, and when I first started using a computer, my dad installed parental controls in order to limit my computer hours and restrict the content I would be able to see.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Now, let&apos;s understand, these systems absolutely sucked. All of them. They blocked like everything; When I first started the computer, I&apos;d get like 3 flashing windows stating that some Internet process from the background processes had been blocked. This, despite me having done absolutely nothing except starting the computer. I also was really interested in the stuff on the Internet; everybody was using facebook to play games, and this was the first time I started thinking about how to subvert these sorts of systems.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Like the DOE filters, the software often relied on blacklists. This meant that they relied on (what was then) humans to report what sites were inappropriate and then update these lists.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">So, of course, like any good Internet kid, I turned towards googling my problems. This led me to realize that proxies were a thing and that there were actually people that already setup proxies for us!</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I got decently good at google DORKs to find these proxies.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Once those proxies got blocked, I connived by playing with iframes and embeds to load these sources. Those got blocked eventually too.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">There was this one time where my brothers and I wanted to play BTD and the control software was blocking it. I noticed that the game was actually a bunch of javascript, and found out successfully that viewing a webpage&apos;s source wasn&apos;t blocked. We could download the resources or assets of a site and reconstruct the page ourselves (which we did with btd and stuff like scratch).</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">In high school, when I got my first laptop, it also had this type of software installed. This was when I first got somewhat serious in mitigation, by booting to sudo mode and doing some stuff that I don&apos;t quite remember (there were tutorials), but completely broke the control software. I was able to figure out how to delete it and from then on, my dad hasn&apos;t bothered to try to install another one.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">With NYCDOE filters on library computers, I started looking at setting up my own proxy. Google translating these webpages has its limits lol. I found this github repository, found out red hat had openshift (which was friendly and catered to individuals to the time) and hosted my own proxy. Playing with VPNs was cool, but we know that they steal and sell your data (there&apos;s a conference talk from the <a href="https://beefproject.com" class="text-gray-700 font-bold bg-red-400">BeEf</a> people).</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I experimented with doing software piracy, particularly for graphic design software, but realized that the Mac App Store has permission controls to prevent unauthorized app running. I didn&apos;t want to entertain the chance of getting served a fine, and my google DORK skills were fairly good so whenever I felt the need or urge to consume tv shows or movies, I relied on those skills instead.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Of course, youtube + dailymotion can only get you so far. Accessing other sites can often be a delicate affair. You don&apos;t know if they have malware or popups or something else. This led me towards realizing that virtualization technology exists, and that you could run operating systems on top of your host operating system. You could securely run containers where you could do whatever you wanted.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">When the free nature of the Internet became alot less free, with knowledge gardens throwing up walls, I did what most people do, open the tab in incognito. When sites started blocking that, I started using services similar to Pocket <a href="https://www.slant.co/topics/5181/viewpoints/3/~read-it-later-apps~readability" class="text-gray-700 font-bold bg-red-400">readability</a> to archive these articles in order to avoid these limits. Some news sites make their articles open if accessed from Google rather than directly. I started messing with html and css in order to get rid of those authwall boxes and overlays.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">At one point, I wanted to create my own site that provided tutorials and educational resources. I was in middle school at the time and the rage for websites was weebly. I started using weebly to host my site, but I quickly got annoyed at the weebly branded logo at the bottom of every page. I quickly realized that weebly&apos;s template editor foolishly included this branding in the template and that although I could not directly remove it, I could render it invisible or prevent it from displaying using CSS (they use js loading now, so the logo is there).</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">All of this stuff made me think about systems, how they were built, how they worked, and how they could be subverted.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">thinking</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I&apos;ve listened to a bunch of podcasts and online talks lately, and I feel like I&apos;m increasingly validated. Most of the sentiment that Naval expresses in his podcast, I already feel and had come to the conclusion prior to watching. The same goes for when Tyler Cowen describes the sort of people he invests in; highly dedicated individuals who prefer to work in small teams.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">My mindset is largely the same in terms of how I approach people. You don&apos;t know anything, so when a person entrusts you with the idea that they have, you should value the fact that they&apos;ve placed this trust in you. You legitimately don&apos;t know who will become the next founder.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I came to the conclusion that lists were important <em class="italics">before</em> reading Sam Altman&apos;s blog. I feel like smart people think alike in terms of the structure of their thinking, but apply it in different ways.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">personal lifestyle</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">This kinda extends from Naval&apos;s podcast that I mentioned earlier. I absolutely hate shallow work. I&apos;m super narrow focused and I&apos;m loosely messy (I know where things are, but its messy). I devote myself to my work in general and that means I would prefer my basic needs to be outsourced / I don&apos;t have to worry about them.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I tend to be highly organized about the things that I care about. Life is limited, so why focus so much time on the things you don&apos;t like, when you can work on the stuff you like (reeks of cs privilege)?</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Ultimately, I&apos;m grateful that the sort of stuff that I like is highly valued in this world and that I have the privilege to not only realize what I want, but to also be in a place where I can satisfy my Maslow hierarchy of needs. Not everyone gets that, which is why I support UBI.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">laziness</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I&apos;m fairly lazy, which tends to push me in the direction of efficiency. I practice efficiency in many areas of my life, whether it&apos;s traveling from point A to point B, dealing with the fragmentation problem, or searching things.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">This led me to play around with automation, especially with selenium and phantomjs, to do some tedious manual labor. It also means that whenever I see an inefficient process, I don&apos;t gradually accept it as a natural extension of how we do things, but look at it as a process for potential improvement (but also considering the human element).</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">efficacy</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I read a book about positive affirmations when I was really young and was introduced to the self-fulfilling prophecy in a middle school forum. I have strong inner self-belief that I will achieve my goals.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">When we have problems, we can pretend they don&apos;t exist or shirk them. I prefer to deal with them directly.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Just because a problem seems hard and doesn&apos;t seem to have a clear explanation, doesn&apos;t mean that we have to abandon it completely. Our gut oftens is a pretty good instinct, and although we can&apos;t quite explain it, we&apos;re making progress as a society towards understanding how to deal with these complex interweaved problems.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">You can internalize it and become apathetic, and even suffer from Stockholm Syndrome as you grow to like it, but the only way to deal with a problem is to deal with it directly, acknowledging all the complexity and working towards it one step at a time.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I don&apos;t plan on having my optimism turning into apathy. My phase of life is just as valid as whatever phase you&apos;re going through. Phases are a false construct that implies the person, as an individual, did not rationally think things though, and will change his mind. It&apos;s really not respectful of that person&apos;s decision-making to say &apos;it&apos;s just a phase&apos;. If I&apos;m going through a phase, you&apos;re going through a phase too. Ageism is bullshit.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">technology agnostic (specifics agnostic)</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">There are alot of people that get caught up on the little details of how they will achieve it.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">By accepting a goal as the default, how you achieve it (in terms of engineer ability, not ethicality) becomes much less important. You have people that need your product, and that means you have to deliver.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Whatever technology gets me there is the one I will adopt for the process, even if I personally don&apos;t like it.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">innovation index</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I&apos;m in New York, which according to the <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24062" class="text-gray-700 font-bold bg-red-400">2017 NBER study</a>, has a high innovation index. This is furthered by the fact that the high school that I went to has a high index of people that become inventors. Naval Ravikant (angellist), the Uretsky brothers (digital ocean), and bram cohen (bittorrent) all went to my high school. I attend hackathons and conferences where the innovation indices are also high.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I&apos;m still not in an ideal area in terms of innovation, given that San Francisco is supposedly the Schelling point for innovation and being weird. I&apos;d ideally like to experience it in the near term future.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">creativity</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I created this virtual world I called &apos;game life&apos; since I was like a really young kid and I somehow got my brothers to play in this weird thought experiment for over 10 years. I adapted this virtual world to better suit whatever they preferred.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">underestimation of value</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">There&apos;s a David Perell tweet about how one reason people choose to become innovators is because conventional society rejects them. Their value is often underestimated.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I feel this. As someone who really has a bad system one train of thought, I don&apos;t really like or do well on tests without serious <em class="italics">serious</em> preparation. I don&apos;t like memorization, especially rote memorization.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">I also have SAD (maybe aspergers) which means that its hard for me to have in-person presence (there&apos;s the psychological fade in conversations) and for me to speak up.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Burning out in high school crushed my grades and I was never really good at the bottoms-up approach of math and science.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">It&apos;s really about derivation of value, and I find that a narrow-focused creative generalist thinker is probably better suited towards building something from the ground up instead of working towards building a feature or doing devops in some large corporation.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">I have a vision</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">In high school, I stumbled upon a study where I found that most kids who went to ivy schools and didn&apos;t get a stem degree, ended up doing consulting. They&apos;re really smart, but they don&apos;t quite know what they want to do, and so these corporations swoop in, promising them six-figure jobs to do really boring work that doesn&apos;t make the world better.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">experience</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">My parents did a good job in terms of giving me a wide spread of experiences. I did chess, martial arts, swimming, art, and spanish classes as a kid.</p>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Whenever we go vacationing, there&apos;s always some form of educational aspect to it. When we went to California, we went to the defunct astronomical observatory.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">advertising</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">All the advertising that I get on facebook and twitter and other social networks are career pages for highly reputable companies so their algorithms think I&apos;m doing something right.</p>
<h2 class="text-3xl mt-8">literally where I live</h2>
<p class="mt-8 leading-loose">Inside my borough of Queens, I live in the neighborhood of Woodside. Woodside, California is a venture capitalist hub.</p>
