One year ago, John Hopkins released a report ranking counties for their resources and preparation for a pandemic. The United States scored first.

This did not come to fruition to put it mildly. In a country that espouses individualism and a do-what-I-want mentality, federal guidelines were sparse and warnings were not headed. This has resulted in the United States being first in COVID deaths, with at least [150k dead](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

To put that number in perspective, we lost [33k](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-many-americans-died-in-korea/) soldiers in the Korean War. In much ballyhooed Vietnam, we lost [\~58k](https://www.archives.gov/research/military/vietnam-war/casualty-statistics). And in WWI, [\~117k](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I/Killed-wounded-and-missing).

Meanwhile, some countries that were more centralized were able to reduce the pandemic's spread. Countries such as China were able to get their numbers under control, although there are valid questions about underreporting.

Centralization makes reacting faster and generally more effective. It's why our military is so hierarchical. By having a centralized military command in the form of reporting to the next man above you, the military is able to make split second decisions. There's no room for questioning things. Imagine if a military officer in the middle of a battle tells the platoon to attack at the same time, but they refuse to do so. Lives get lost.

Decentralization is good for making sure things don't get compromised. Spy networks and terror cells are good examples of this. In order to reject the compromisation of the entire network, you split them up and don't let them know about each other.

Full decentralization eventually atomizes into individualism. There are notable benefits to this approach. For one, research has demonstrated that a group of people thinking independently of one another tend to predict things better than a single person. Individualism (given proper deficit addressing with safety nets) encourages diversity as every person is free to do as he or she pleases. You get more viewpoints, more ideas, more weird quirky things that make life what it is.

Decentralization also helps prevent lock-in, whether it be a country's currency or a technology platform. If you're in a place where the currency is volatile or hyperinflationary, you'd want to exchange it for something more stable.

Additional benefits include reducing your data footprint to what's needed (think dumb components) and resisting monopolization by eschewing any sort of central data store. With crypto and P2P, authorities can't just raid or take your servers down in a fell swoop. This is important in fighting censorship and political repression.

However, as Peter Thiel makes clear in Zero to One, [certain fields lead to monopolies.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041415/what-are-common-examples-monopolistic-markets.asp) Monopolies are a textbook definition of centralized power. We see this in Google Search (just want best results), electricity (costs + standardization), and Amazon (want packages delivered as quick, cheap, and safely as possible). Industries such as social media rely actively on the network effect, wherein the winners by definition have to be monopolies. In some of these cases, we sorta want monopolies since there's standardization. Chain stores are ubiquitous across the world for a reason: you have an idea of what things and what service you're gonna get.

Sure, it might be fun to play around with and use a search engine like duckduckgo (which I do). But when it comes to crunch time, the search engine that has collected the most data about me, the one that is the most invasive is the one I turn to (why don't we have user-controlled levels of invasiveness? ðŸ¤”).

Currency would also be something for which a full-blown monopoly might actually be better at. Consider that money is an abstract concept. What we really want is purchasing power. If we can buy more stuff with the same amount of money (how far your dollar goes), it's generally a good thing.

The problem is, of course, inflation. As I documented in my How To Frame the World post, there are three main objections towards just giving everybody tons of money. One was that there was previously no mechanism to distribute it all equally. The government was great at collecting taxes, but terrible at giving money. The second is that when demand exceeds supply, costs adjust and go up (our world is abundant so not an issue). The last is foreign exchange markets.

With crypto, you can switch to a more stable currency if your country's currency is hyperinflationary. Why would you want to do this?

The world is super global and imports and exports from each other. When hyperinflation happens it messes up this balance. People will start to refuse using the currency because it's value has depreciated relative to the others.

The keyword is relative. If the entirety of Earth was subject to one protogovernment with a monopoly on currency, hyperinflation by giving money to everyone wouldn't depreciate the value since there's no other currency to compare it to.

Inflation occurs because a country wants to maintain that it's own currency has real value. If Japan were to quadruple it's yen production, the United States, out of supply/demand and fear of Japanese import costs, will update it's exchange rate. If Americans find the price of a Japanese car higher, or that their dollar doesn't go as far in Japan as it used to, it doesn't bear well for the administration.

This focus on arbitrarily setting exchange rates results in a low baseline threshold wherein ironically countries are incentivized to keep their market cap low and kill liquidity. If you increase your market cap, your currency gets devalued.

Monopolies do not have to deal with negative sum games or zero sum games at the level we do since they ensure that there are no other players in their respective fields. The budget required to maintain a monopoly is much less than trying to create one. The people trying to undermine your monopoly aren't as coordinated. With a singular government, you have a monopoly over violence, currency, and the resources. They can deal with systemic deficits such as pollution or mess much more easily since they can reach consensus much faster than a bunch of independent agents. If they decide to try to solve climate change, there's no 50% opposition that springs up to fight them tooth and nail.

Centralization has it's own downfalls, of course. It's an all or nothing approach which is volatile and subject to the whim of an individual or few individuals. Concentrated power tends to eat itself.

One phenomenon I'd like to explore in further detail is that of centralization-decentralization. That is, a process of centralization happens to an industry, before decentralization happens. The best example of this is the Internet. The Internet relies on a centralized set of servers and wiring in order to allow everybody to communicate with one another. This centralization creates a unified infrastructure that enables decentralization since no single server has all the data. The data is also highly replicated.

What got the Internet started, however, were centralized services that enabled people to communicate and send money to each other. As much as people lament the decline and loss of the quirky indie web, platforms like Facebook and PayPal were instrumental to the growth of the Internet. When the Internet became something that had utility, it accumulated a critical mass of users to become what it is.

As issues plague these platforms, we are increasingly seeing platforms and apps emerge that do not retain a stranglehold on your data. This means there is no loss friction that becomes accumulated as you continue to use the platform. In this way, you get a freer market, as people can leave and choose as they please, instead of getting locked in.

Consider the United States government and banks, both of which rely on decades-old technology without any option of fixing it. [A decent portion of infrastructure relies on COBOL](https://thenewstack.io/cobol-everywhere-will-maintain/), an outdated language that has [fewer and fewer users each year](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html).

As the infrastructure handles all their data, it is super hard to get out and change their provider. There are so many edge contingencies and things that are happening in the code base, that the government is largely resigned to paying an increased premium for dwindling COBOL programmers.

Decentralization fixes this by abstracting the data layer away from the display layer, making the display layer dumb and ensuring that [the parts are interchangeable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney#Interchangeable_parts).

We can see another clear example in the ongoing shift from flat files to the JAMstack. Flat files are just files that are served up by some server. Creation is tedious and there is not much interchangeability. You have to focus on both content and markup when you really should be focused on only one.

JAMstack and CMSs changes that by again unbundling the data from the markup, such that some newspaper editor or some blogger can write what they want without having to write any markup. The ability of the Internet was first realized through the creation of centralized flat files. This allowed people with technical acumen to write and display stuff on the Internet. More hacky centralized solutions evolved afterwords to enable more people to contribute to the Internet, but the friction involved in using them was and is still relatively high. Security concerns, slow loading times, etc.
