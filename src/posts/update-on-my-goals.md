My goals are located [here](https://unintendedcon.github.io/goals).

If you're feeling bad about whatever goals you set, I only got a single one done.

I'll go through them line by line.

The first one was release two blog posts a month. This seemed relatively easy at the time given that I had gotten on a pretty good roll. Nevertheless, I underwent a mental health crisis and nothing got published for three months. I've started to resume it now, and I think that I'll be able to publish my thoughts (for better or worse) on a bimonthly basis.

The passive income one also didn't come to fruit as I pretty much abandoned everything. See above. I think I'm onto something, but I'm modifying the goalpost for it making money to before I graduate. I underestimated the time cost of building something unique as a person who doesn't do a ton of frontend stuff.

The hackathon one was complete, but I do them all the time so there wasn't any real friction there. Hackathons went online also, making it even easier to participate (although potentially harder to collaborate).

The conference one also didn't happen. I watched after-talks of Prisma Day, but I haven't applied to any conferences. I don't think I intend on any in the future also.

The talk has not happened yet, and with COVID, the talk probably isn't gonna happen. Virtual talks are not the same.

My flossing has not increased.

After using makerlog for a couple weeks, I've pretty much abandoned it. It's fine, but my schedule feels highly irregular and not conducive to shipping day by day.

COVID-19 has thrown a wrench in meeting people personally.

It did the same with biking given New York instituted strict stay-at-home orders during the crisis.

I'm pretty comfortable right now, so I don't think I did anything that was quite out of my comfort zone. Being a bit uncomfortable is a good thing.

I think I'm gonna concentrate my efforts on three things: schoolwork, writing, and building a product. I stopped exercising regularly with this pandemic and I need to get on that asap. With the stuff that's happening, I'm not sure I'll get the chance to do that stuff openly outside in a couple months.
