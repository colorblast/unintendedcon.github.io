Polywork is interesting. In today's mercenary market, it's pretty clear that the winning approach is the Google market, i.e. show how much you contributed to the revenue of a given company via X or Y features. Things that cannot be easily quantified or do not fit a company's framework for quantification are not gauged. There have been many gripes about this, but there doesn't seem to be an easy solution.

Polywork is attempting to go about showing these intangibles by shortening up the loop. It's function seems to be a cross between Twitter and Linkedin, where you post whatever's on your mind (shorter content), but the content is work-related. I'm naturally pretty skeptical of these things; past a certain number of users, I feel you will always end up where Linkedin right now is. Nevertheless, the problem is real. The incentive behind Twitter is advertising rather than making it easy to document all the work-related things you've done. Linkedin's already terrible and largely captured by sales leads + thinkfluencers + hiring teams so Polywork arguably couldn't be worse. Nevertheless, Polywork isn't charging anything (at least not yet) for users, so the money flow they're betting on is hiring. I'm not sure if it can sustain the power dynamics inherent in that sort of relationship long enough to cause any meaningful effect to companies and their hiring pipelines.

I still feel like it's an interesting experiment and if it helps some people get jobs that they would've have otherwise gotten as a side effect, that's great. Relatively speaking, that's a good use of VC money.
