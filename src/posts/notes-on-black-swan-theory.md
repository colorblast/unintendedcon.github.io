* "I also make the bolder (and more annoying) claim that in spite of our progress and growth, or perhaps because of such progress and growth, the future will be increasingly less predictable, while both human nature and social 'science' seems to conspire to hide the idea from us"


* Recursive - "increasing number of feedback loops"
* "events can happen because they are not supposed to happen"
* Against incrementalism
* Compartmentalization a.k.a. non-application of learned knowledge into real world
* Round-trip fallacy (no evidence of such = evidence of no such thing)
* effort and usefulness against time
* confirmation bias
  * we don't seek potential flaws in our beliefs (p.c. wason)
* fallibility to narration
* Andrey Nikolayevich's Rule
  * information is costly to obtain
  * information is costly to store
  * information is costly to manipulate and retrieve
* Kolmogorov Complexity
  * minimum length to record something
* Probability estimations may add up past 100%
* "Prediction, not narration, is the real test of our understanding of the world"
* Paul Meehl and Robyn Dawes - the "expert" is the closest thing to a fraud
* fair coin is flipped 100 times and is heads every time. What is the probability of heads the next time? -- ability to think outside the box / problem definitions
* experts who tend to be experts
  * livestock judges, astronomers, test pilots, soil judges, chess masters, physicists, mathematicians (when they deal with mathematical problems, not empirical ones), accountants, grain inspectors, photo interpreters, insurance analysts
* experts who tend not to be experts
  * stockbrokers, psychologists, psychiatrists, college admission officers, court judges, councilors, personnel selectors, intelligence analysts, + (taleb's list) economists, financial forecasters, finance professors, political scientists, "risk experts", personal finance advisers
* lucas critique - predictions for policy making cannot be accurately gauged for effectiveness because the policymakers adjust accordingly.
* Three fallacies
  * ignorance of confidence intervals
  * forecast degradation (can't see future black swan events with new unexpected variables)
  * more extreme optimism or pessimism
* sir francis bacon "the most important advances are the least predictable ones, those 'lying out of the path of the imagination'
  * arthur koestler "the sleepwalkers"
* the purpose that we use things for were likely to be unintended consequences
  * the internet's purpose was not voip for example
  * viagra was intended to relieve blood hypertension
  * dotcom overinvestment in fiber cables gave way to modern internet

* "luck favors the prepared"
* journalism sucks (I disagree with this when the journalism is longform, you can find good longform content at longform.org or look at the atavist magazine)
* systems are super complex to make accurate long-term predictions
  * billiard balls do not have free will yet they set off a complex set of interactions
  * chaos theory
* hayak - the pretense of knowledge
* tunneling syndrome
* Platonic vs. a-Platonic
  * Platonic is formulaic, closed-minded, self-serving, commoditized
  * A-platonic is bottom-up, open-minded, skeptical, and empirical
* Asymmetric World
* Fractals and Moving Specs
* Ludic Fallacy 
  * we cannot determine real-world independence, something we can assume in games and automatically apply to the real world.
* Against the Gaussian Curve (Normal curve); Asymmetries are the norm
* "The Open Society and Its Enemies"

There are obviously some people who don't like Taleb's style or haughtiness. I think despite this, many of Taleb's ideas are provocative, particularly that of the ludic fallacy and fractals. I think I like Fooled By Randomness more, however.
