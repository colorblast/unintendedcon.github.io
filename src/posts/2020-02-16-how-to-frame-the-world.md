THIS IS A WIP DRAFT AND IS NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED.

tldr: our representations suck, but we're working on making them better and I'm optimistic.

This post is a response to memetic theory. As provocative and interesting as it sounds, I'm a fundamentally optimistic person who shares a different worldview. If you're not sure what memetic theory is, it is the theory that humans, regardless of age, are highly immitative of each other. Since we're tribalistic, we have to find someone or something to be the other. Whenever anyone breaks the code of the tribe, regardless of who you are or what you've done, the tribe will sacrifice you.

That's super grim and as much as I entertained the notion, I like my theory better. My theory is that the world is complex, our lifespan is limited, and that every single communication / action is fundamentally a tradeoff. The way we are achieving progress is by broadening the choice of actions for future generations. Argument happens because we have limited representations of what are, in actuality, complex spaces. We have not achieved the understanding that we quite seek, but we are working to get there.

## things are complicated

I struggled with depression a couple of years ago. The act of waking up and proceeding with the day felt like torture and I couldn't really feel anything. I didn't feel like I had anyone to rant to.

One thing that made me feel better about my depression was discovering Allie Brosh's webcomic [*Hyperbole and a Half*](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com). The comics are super funny, not just for the wholesomeness (and meme material), but also the relatability and accurate depiction of depression. Brosh dropped out of the public sphere a couple of years ago, and so when looking for more material, I found [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl8_g72zEUQ) by her on this JoCo Cruise.

In the talk, Brosh states how we often represent ourselves as reductionized forms of ourselves, say a triangle. She then draws a bunch of zig-zags and swirls and things that this language cannot really represent or define, over that triangle, to represent what a human is.

It's a known problem that linguistics has its limitations. If you're a bilingual speaker, there's a high chance that you've had an experience where there's a concept in one language for which there is not quite a direct translation in the other.

It's also a known fact that human life is finite. We value our own time. The way how we express this is through machine-like indifference and efficiency. Every person has some self-interest involved. Sometimes self-interests can align. But ultimately, everyone is interested in something that provides value to themselves or enhances their own lives. We can see how this self-interest reflects in how we communicate.

Unless we have immense familiarity (or no familiarity at all but the interaction is a chance no-stakes occurence) with the person at hand, we reductionize ourselves to whatever category society applies to us. For the majority of us, we derive our value from gainful employment; we associate ourselves with the labels of 'lawyer', 'banker', 'teacher', 'social worker', etc. Human life is finite, and there is a high chance that if you and the other person don't really care about the interaction, that this imperfect reductionized fib is fine.

## analog world

It is a fact that the world is imperfect. Everything in the world is analog, yet for us to make any meaning out of it, we have to create digital versions of them. Any CS student is familiar with the fact that floating point numbers cannot quite be represented by a computer. It is, at best, an estimate.

Audiophiles no doubt, have noticed a difference between listening to a digital recording of music on a service like Spotify vs. attending a live music concert. Photographers have noticed the difference between the actual observance of a thing vs the photograph of it.

The world, in a sense, can only be understood by us compressing this analog information into imperfect digital information. Although this information is imperfect, its usable information. Here's a somewhat decent analogy: think of a human as a computer with only so much space. Since we have so many interactions, by nature, we have to compress a bunch of these files in order to retain their memories.

We create digital categories for how we represent information. We apply heuristics and pattern-matching to determine what a chair is. In biology, we apply taxonomy to create classes of animals. In education, we come up with different mental models of students. In politics, we have different tents and umbrellas for different ideologies. 

## trust

We have limited lifespan which by induction, means that we have limited experience. Thus, our understanding of our world is capped by our lives. In order for us to make decisions and just be the social species that we are, we have to form trust. We have to determine exactly what sort of people are trustworthy. For many people, this means people that are like them. Given that kids are very much influenced by their parents (which I think Girard overbroadens to the whole of society) and the fact that people seek people like them, it is highly likely that everyone will form this bubble or echo chamber. For more on this, you can see Nicky Case's (and Vi Hart's) [Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/).

## our models for understanding suck

### geography

One of the best examples of this is our mapping systems. Explorers and traders needed to figure out where they were going, and to do that, they needed a model of where everything was. The limitation, of course, was that the only material available for this was paper, which is two-dimensional. Given the world is circular and 3-dimensional, the challenge of representing our world in 2-d without significant distortions was a huge challenge.

This was something that afflicted the Mercator Projection, where certain countries were distorted far further (looking at you Greenland!). We've tried to account for this with the Robinson Projection, but it's still imperfect.

### science

To understand things, in science, we most commonly use models. There are many interactions, so we rely on things like environmental models to emulate the interactions between things like the sun, our atmosphere, the clouds, and plants.

Climate change gets disputed because 

### politics

We've seen that since 2016, that in politics, the statistical models have been kinda lowkey terrible. As much as Nate Silver would like to say that his models are performing, they simply haven't.

In politics, the most common representation of how voters are aligned is a spectrum. It goes from left to right, with supposedly different levels of an ideology representing where you were on the spectrum. The problem, as clearly shown in 2016, is that this is an oversimplification. Many people who had previously voted for Obama voted for Trump in 2016. What gives?

The spectrum is an inaccurate digital model of an analog phenomenon. It fails to account for edge contingencies like someone who has strongly held views that are spread fairly even across the entire spectrum. A person could have strong feelings about small government (a traditional conservative platform), but support all the social platforms and ideas that are traditionally associated with liberalism.

It fails to account for voter apathy or for people who simply don't like any of the provided ideologies.

In the creation of the spectrum, much like the compression of an image from a physical setting, value is lost, and some of it is critical.

## human life is limited

Human life is finite. We have only so much life and thus, [only so much time](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html). This means we are resource-constrained to make the most of it. We'd like our lives to be fulfulling, to have some sort of purpose or value, however we define it. It can mean many things. For some people, this purpose is status or power. For others, its intrinsic value (the act of existing). It could be relational. It doesn't matter for the purpose of this thought experiment.

## we need to communicate

Humanity has shaped the world the most out of everything on Earth. We've learned how to work together, how to farm, how to specialize, how to industrialize, and how to send a man to the moon. Heck, we're thinking of establishing a space colony!

The way we've been able to do this is through communication. There are many mediums through which communication can happen, but the key is that these humans agree on shared representation for what a 'thing' is. These people have to agree on how much a meter is if they want to safely send a spaceship into space.

The thing is, it's a known phenomenon that linguistics has its limitations. Bilingual people are most familiar with this, where they may have one concept or thing that is easily able to be expressed in one language, but cannot quite be expressed in the other.

When we entertain the age-old philosophy question of what exactly is a chair, we cannot quite define what a chair is. We have a good sense of heuristics, a good sense of the characteristics of a chair, but no quite clear rule.
