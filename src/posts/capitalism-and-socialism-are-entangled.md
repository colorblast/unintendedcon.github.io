I've noticed that in mainstream discourse, capitalism and socialism are referred to as two disparate systems. This could hardly be further from the truth.

Capitalism offers dynamism and progress, but with the winner take all system it espouses, the effects become increasingly concentrated. This alienates many.

Socialism is a system that is reactionary to the ill effects of this winner-take-all system. It is a critique that grounds its base in labor and equality.

We see capitalism in the United State's laissez-faire attitude towards regulation of capital accumulation and socialism in it's welfare programs.

The irony is that neither system can exist without the other. Progress and wealth becomes increasingly irrelevant if it does not disperse to the rest of society. If quality of life and life expectancy are going down on average, capitalism becomes largely irrelevant on a day to day basis.

Socialism also fails on its own. The traditional line of critique here is that people are super lazy and not incentivized to work, but this line of thought is wrong. Work is ingrained in our social consensus and how many of us derive meaning. Americans work more than ever before, and this culture that we've created should mean that this shouldn't change in the near future.

Rather, it fails because the apparatus used to principally achieve its goals (government) is notoriously bureaucratic, slow-moving, corrupt, and fairly incompetent. Individual socialism a.k.a. rights have worked notoriously well.

Human society is largely based off exploitation. Exploitation of humans and power dynamics enabled us to build infrastructure for the future. In a zero-sum world, where humans are the only force (labor), this inequality and exploitation is largely necessary such that we can have a better future. The enlightenment exists because a bunch of guys didn't have to work because of said exploitation.

This is what makes me so bullish on automation and open source. Robots can not only do this labor better than us, but if we create the right policies, can make this world of abundance more abundant. With the socialization of our deficiencies, capitalism can be expanded to everyone and accelerate progress.
