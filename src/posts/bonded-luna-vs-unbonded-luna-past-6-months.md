We can see here from the graph that bonded Luna has remained static largely for the past 6 months, increasing slightly in correlation with general Luna inflation. This is probably because of better arb opportunities in the Luna ecosystem, particularly with Mirror and Anchor. One thing to note here is that although Luna supply took a dip, bonded Luna remained static.
