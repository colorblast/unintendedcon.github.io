Whenever I feel really bad about my position in life, I will search up Youtube videos about asylum seekers. These asylum seekers spend their lives going through an arduous process, full of real physical danger, only to reach the border of a given country where they may be stonewalled by paperwork and a citizenry that doesn't want them. By and large, the circumstances remind me that however bad I have it today, there are millions upon millions of people who would exchange their position for what I have: a relatively safe and secure existence where the government is not totally parasitical and has some function.

I've noticed a pattern across orgs for the past couple decades where the burden of positional knowledge has increased without any sort of increase in training for that particular skill, particularly at the entry point to the pipeline. Similar to how the EU has reduced its migrant crisis (an uncomfortable truth) by stopping the immigrants in countries like Morocco (and thus preventing the number from being measured), we see that power dynamics and the loss of org-men (scratch your back I scratch yours too) has resulted in a very bimodal marketplace, where those who are senior command higher and higher premiums in exchange for little to no loyalty while those who are junior are stuck with an asymmetric system where they put a ton in and get very little out. Companies resist training people since they don't know how long they'll last with them.

You would think this would be fairly solvable, have some sort of lockup period, i.e. similar to sports where you draft people and get a certain number of guaranteed years.

I've also noticed this in the community I live in. I've lived in the same neighborhood for most of my life, and I've seen it slowly turn from a majority Hispanic neighborhood adjacent to industrial warehouses, sewage processing centers, and cemeteries to Manhattan 2.0. Gentrification, people. That's besides the point though. I've noticed that these are the sorts of people to make symbolic hand-wavy gestures towards community, recycling, fair trade, and certain other cultural values. I'm not gonna state whether I believe these values are congruent or not. I personally don't care. What I do want to get across is that for the most part, this stuff is all purely symbolic, that the organic stuff is probably not organic just like the fish you order at a restaurant has a decent chance of not being that fish. The recycling that you do has a decent chance of being discarded as trash and burnt. Not to say you shouldn't do these things. You do you. But one shouldn't suddenly operate from some place of moral superiority, deningrating people for not understanding a system that you probably don't understand either. One seems to forget that outsourcing responsibility for knowledge on random popular whims is more exclusionary than inclusionary.
