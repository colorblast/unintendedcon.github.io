I've been sick the past week, so I was unable to create any new blog posts during this duration of time.

The past election cycle saw an unprecedented rise in the amount of disinformation and bias in media publishing. This phenomenon gave rise to the terminology of fake news, and explained why America was so polarized.

Yet, when these people meet in-person, they find more often than not, that they share more commonalities than differences. Given that we're all fundamentally human, it is often the case that we share similar interests and do similar things.

## photos vs experience

There is an interesting thought experiment where one examines the experience of going to the Grand Canyon vs photos of it. Most people will defer to the person who has actually been to the Grand Canyon, but the majority would also say that they know what the Grand Canyon looks like.

If someone were to ask these people to describe the Grand Canyon, they'd most likely describe what's in the photo.

Let's up the ante. What if the person who went to the Grand Canyon was color-blind or had some sort of visual distortion. If we were to visit the Grand Canyon in the future, and were looking to find a place to camp, would we trust a bunch of photos or the person who had camped there before?

When it comes to some particular areas, areas where we are highly tribalistic, these distortions often show up in great number.

## marginalized groups / identity politics

## distinguishment between the individual and the systemic
