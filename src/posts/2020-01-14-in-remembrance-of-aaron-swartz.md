Quick reminder that 3 days ago, January 11th, is the 7th year anniversary where the American legal system unjustly drove Aaron Swartz to suicide.

Aaron was the pioneer of RSS, having joined a usenix group at the age of 14. He was an important pioneer of the Internet, forming Creative Commons, working on Reddit and open source, and creating Markdown.

If you can, you should donate and/or support the [EFF](https://www.eff.org).
