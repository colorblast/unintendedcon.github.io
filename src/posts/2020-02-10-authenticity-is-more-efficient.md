If you're a developer, you're no doubt familiar with the term 'single source of truth'. For state management, you want unidirectional data flow, because things can, *will*. get really messy real fast.

You should totally apply this to yourself as a person. You should be working to achieve your goals and the easiest way to achieve this is to devote as much of your focus towards doing so. This means that complications such as lying or being manipulative means an extra mental burden.

You should also consider that the world is much more flatter, which means that news travels faster and everybody is more connected. In a more globalized society, breaking trust has greater implications.

Progress is, in general, a win-win game. Although technology, as a whole, may be a neutral, progress is definitely good, if conducted in a respectful manner (include opt-outs).

People tend to work with people who've they built trust with, something that can be easily lost when that trust is broken. Being inauthentic means that you have to play psychological games with people and yourself, and it means just extra managing.

If you find yourself dealing with some sort of childhood trauma, you should take active steps toward remedying it (therapist + proper treatment). The energy required to do both is not worth it.
