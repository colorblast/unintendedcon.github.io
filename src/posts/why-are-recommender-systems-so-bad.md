There is a vast ocean of content out there on the Internet. There's so much in fact, that you have to rely on some middleman to determine what content to show to you.

In the case of a search engine such as Google, this thing should most optimally be the direct answer to your query.

In the case of a social network such as Facebook or Twitter, it should be whatever is most interesting or relevant to you.

Yet, we increasingly complain about these things. Social networks are much maligned, with issues of bias, moderation, censorship, and curation all plaguing it. This also affects search engines, albeit to a much lesser extent.

Why is this?

I think this is to do with the word "you". Tim Urban has a [Wait But Why post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) where he explores how humans have developed and why they procrastinate. He determines that the human brain has two parts: the Rational Decision-Maker and the Instant Gratification Monkey. The Instant Gratification monkey exemplifies system one thinking, where it goes on instincts and emotion. The Rational Decision-Maker takes longer to think about things and is generally super slow. This is explored in extreme detail by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky with their studies in [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/kahneman-excerpt-thinking-fast-and-slow/).

They also show that emotion is the driving factor between decisions which means we have a preternatural bias towards system one thinking.

And as such, we get where we are.

But the question still lingers. I've surely used a social network like Twitter to stay informed on stuff. I've certainly learned stuff on Youtube. There's educational stuff like OpenCourseWare on there. Why can't we get recommended the good stuff, or even better, have separate recommendation feeds based off what type of system we're thinking in? ðŸ¤”

I have astonishingly little control over what enters my Twitter feed and what doesn't. There's a list of topics that Twitter will tell me informs it's recommendations, but for the most part, it's a black box.

This becomes a problem when we determine that there are three types of situations that exist: positive sum, zero sum, and negative sum. Social platforms embraces all three, but especially zero sum.

The positive sum stuff is what I'm actually looking for. When I originally decided to use Twitter, it was because of some awesome piece of content on there. I continue to use Twitter because I continue to hope for and look for more awesome pieces of content. The rarity of this establishes a [hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill).

**Growth of social media is increased due to controversy**. Entertainment that wants to be viral needs to have lots of engagement. Reality shows and soaps best exemplify this by manufacturing controversy to increase viewership.

The one startup that was working in this vertical, [Canopy](https://canopy.cr/), got [bought out by CNN.](https://canopy.cr/post/canopy-is-joining-cnn)

In VC-landia where growth is the One and Only True Metric, we can see that quality social media is incompatible. Stuff like Tim Urban's posts take forever to create, so terrible filler stuff gets dumped in your feed instead while you're waiting. It's very similar to Netflix's approach wherein they've shifted from high quality shows to churning out low quality content that is meant to subsist you and keep you on your subscription until the next blockbuster comes out.

One can create feeds for yourself by using multiple accounts. Defaults rule, however, and it [can take just one accidental search to cause complete feed contamination](https://twitter.com/noampomsky/status/1278140551162822657).

There should be antifragility and hardening done by the platform to maintain this context-switching. You should be able to purge it from the factor list and/or the system should be able to do it for you.

Social media sites should really do this given that the rational side, if kept in a good state, lends itself to monopoly and a continued user base, whereas the emotional one is fad-based. See Gen-Z switch from Facebook to Vine to Snapchat to Instagram to TikTok as proof of that.
