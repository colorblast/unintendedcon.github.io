There's a Google Zeitgeist [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7J-wCHDJYmo) about the lack of follow-through on STEM degrees in America. Malcolm Gladwell makes an argument that despite elite colleges being bastions of brilliance (with the funding to boot), the STEM dropout rate is largely the same.

Given the amount of freedom and career prospects that a STEM degree brings, Gladwell argues that this is why you shouldn't send your kid to a school like Harvard, where things can be very competitive and your chance of graduating with a STEM degree can actually be lower. Since the dropout rate is the same across schools, he theorizes that its better to be a big fish in a small pond.

I take a few issues with that. Funding. Inspiration. The fact that I don't really care about grades besides maintaining them on the veneer of respectability. But this post is about relativism.

## trying to do too much

You know these people. Chances are, if you're reading this, that you _are_ one of these people.

You get As in class, despite cutting half of them, so that you can also do NSF and Intel-Siemens research. You tote your bottles of Soylent everywhere, stating that you, yes you!, simply don't have 15 minutes of time to eat lunch. You do band, pre-med society, and are the president of some book club that exists in theory, but really only meets once a year for the GIM. When someone asks you how the fuck you do all this stuff, while maintaining coursework, tutoring underprivileged kids, and volunteering for Red Cross, you state

> haha. haha. Well I try my best.

or

> I get no sleep!!!

Doing this stuff is cool, in terms of exploring things. It also supposedly is good at gaming the college process, to show that you're not their prototypical candidate.

This culture is kinda toxic though. It's better than everybody being absolute slackers, but there is no moderation. And I don't think this sort of culture is conducive towards working towards your own goals.

It's very easy to, given the competitive nature of things, to see other people doing so many things, and internally thinking...

> fuck. fuck. Fuckety fuck. Why the fuck can't I be like that? Why didn't I think of doing that?

or

> &gt;Person&lt; sucks. Who cares about his stupid club anyways???

and just so many other negative things. Not that I've ever thought of those types of things.

You have to understand that you are you, with your own individual goals (if you don't have one, find a principle). Success from the people around you can feel terrible, especially in a school setting, which is, let's admit it, mostly a zero-sum game.

The world is not a zero-sum game with only a limited amount of spots. There are so many new ways to bring value and good to the world. Just because there's this path that everyone is following, doesn't mean that you have to follow it. Be smarter.

There's alot of assumptions that we learn early on from our parents, peers, and environment. Most of this is good. It ensures that we can fit into being the 60% middle part of the society. But to reach the top 20%, you really have to question these assumptions, stop solely deriving your value from relativism in high-stress environments, and just think about why you are doing the things you are doing.
