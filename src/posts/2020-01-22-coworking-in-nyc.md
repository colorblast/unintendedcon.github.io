    Here's a more recent list of awesome coworking spaces (free). Much more recent than that 2017 builtinnyc article.

When I first looked for free coworking spaces, the most recent article I came upon was a 2017 builtinnyc article. Since then, places like the Wix Lounge have closed :(.

This list is more geared towards software engineers and is based on my personal experience. I stayed out of hotels in general, although I hear they're awesome (Ace Hotel comes to mind).

1. AWS Popup Loft

Pros:
The AWS Loft had decent hours, has an outside area for phone calls, and is extremely easy to get started with. Signing in is relatively frictionless since they use your Amazon account. Amazon tends to host talks and developer workshops downstairs and if you have questions about AWS, there are definitely people there to help.

Cons: This place gets crowded *fast*. There's generally a line that starts forming in the morning, when it starts opening up. The plug:chair ratio is also kinda meh, especially on the balcony.

2. A/D/O

Pros:
A/D/O is located in Williamsburg and just looks beautiful. It has a beautiful art installation outside, and wasn't crowded at all when I was there.

Cons:
There's like maybe one guy running everything which is not necessarily bad.

3. Literally any NYPL Library.

This is rather obvious.
