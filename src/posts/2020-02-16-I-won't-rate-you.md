title: I Won't Rate You

  - There's a ton of rating that happens with our algorithms. I like to think of myself as at least somewhat humanistic, so no I won't rate you. Also, it means that I don't play the status games.

One of my core beliefs is that I won't rate you. I can tell you how well or bad you are doing at something, but I will not rate you in some listicle thing or fashion. I won't tell you a number from 1 to 10 for how attractive you are or where you stand on some top 30 list. It really doesn't matter to me, because you are you. You and I have better things to do.

Naval Ravikant states that there are two games: the wealth game and the status game. I think that's actually an oversimplification, but I haven't quite figured out a paradigm for my train of thought so we'll proceed on this imperfect model. For the most part, I do agree with how he describes the status game.

The status game is zero-sum. It's relational in the sense that your worth is only determined in a relativistic manner. It's the system that you were preconditioned to learn and adapt to in your 12 years (American system) of schooling. Grades are often distributed across a normal distribution or something similar, meaning that you don't actually have to do well or try to learn, you simply have to do better than your peers.

Since the status game is zero sum, it means that the only way to gain status is for someone else to lose status. This can be cutthroat; just look at the stuff we have to do to get into college.

The status game lends itself to either mob mentality or elitism. I don't think that either of those are particularly desirable nor add something significant to the world. It encourages less thinking and reasoning, and more conniving and metagaming.

There's too much to do this in this world in terms of fixing problems and just making the world better to gossip, rate, and just hurt other peoples' feelings.
