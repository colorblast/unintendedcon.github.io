I just finished up reading Cal Newport's [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) and am summarizing what I got from it here.

## Market Inefficiencies

1. The High-skilled workers
2. The Superstars
3. The Owners

To reach category 1 or 2, you need to be able to reach a state of deep work consistently (at least most people).

I largely agree with this assessment; I'm probably shooting for category 1 at the moment.

## Deep Work

I had already come to a similar conclusion regarding shallow work, referring to it as "time sinks".

Really makes the argument that any sort of interuption can cause such disruption of work. Gives a good way to quantify productivity lost (recent college grad estimate).

**A semistructured schedule is optimal for getting work done**. There is a rigidity associated with current structures that many people despise, but greater productivity often comes with a minimal outline.

This means that you should have a good idea for what you might work on tomorrow for example. This also means constantly updating your schedule in order to better rectify for the fact that we as humans are bad at time task estimating. **If something big really comes up, then it's ok to drop this structure to adapt for this idea.**

Makes the case that school periods should be longer I guess. Also really influenced the way I thought about my time when on the train and/or on the bus. I used to burn that time on social media, Reddit, and (gasp) mobile games. I've recently switched to listening to podcasts instead, which has led to increased thinking. I recommend the Deepmind podcast, Indie Hackers, and TWIML.

**Split your deep work time blocks with small shallow work interludes**. I think I'm pretty good at deep work actually, but I often overextended myself over the **ideal 4 hour time block**. After dumping 6 hours+ on something, there really are **diminishing returns** and I can fall into a shallow work timesink.

**Don't confuse busyness with productivity.** The knowledge world can often have work that doesn't exactly have a finished product, something that you can easily attest to when you are a craftsman or farmer. This can often mean that people tend to attempt to derive their worth from shallow  work.

Apparently the working knowledge worker world really burns your time in meetings and emails. Haven't had that experience so far, but I've just been an intern ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

## Principle of Least Resistance (PLR)

There is an attention economy. **Every tool has some form of benefits, but they also have associated drawbacks in things like time and opportunity cost**. Think long-term. If you're a CS major, think of every thing you literally use as a data structure, if that helps.

**We tend to default to whatever is easiest (inertia!) whenever we face a decision, if we don't want to think things thoroughly**. Explains why we do so much shallow work.

## Craftsmanship

Value from craftsmanship is derived in it of itself. There is inherent value in the laborious creation.

## Sleep, The Unconscious Mind, and Anxiety

Baumeister psychology study where it showed that anxiety is decreased and fulfillment is increased when you have at least a minimal plan to deal with something. This can help with sleep.

**Shallow work interludes provide the unconscious mind the opportunity to work on problems**, which allows us to get more work done than what is capped by those 4 hour deep work timeblocks.

## Reset Expectations

**No one ever really says bye online**. Yes, if you're taking a vacation or some sort of extended stay physically, but otherwise no. It's like this superlong, never-ending conversation. It's clearly an attention hack.

I believe that there is definitely some good that can come from conversation termination. **The expectation that this social media setting creates is that if someone sends a message, they are expected to reply back, and not just reply back, but *reply back immediately*. This is bad for deep work.**

The key metric for many apps is engagement, which means increased attention and time spent on the app. There is this psychological twist, whereby if you don't receive a reply back, you feel hurt or anxious. We've been conditioned to expect immediate replies back as the new norm.

**There are ways to reset the expectations created by these communication environments**. Like cryptocurrency, you can adjust the sender:replier work ratio by adding work. The amount of work involved in sending out an email or question is often much less than that of creating a thoughtful reply. You can adjust this by stating some conditions that people must abide by in order to receive a reply. Correspondences who don't meet this requirement simply don't get a reply. **The key is to being forward, stating this resetting in a transparent and open manner, to prevent feelings from getting hurt**.

## Things I Didn't Agree With

Newport might've been a little too hard on social media. I used Facebook for schoolwork groups. I'm currently using Twitter and Linkedin to stay up to date with cutting edge development practices and networking. If you can manage the amount of time you spend on the apps, which tools like Digital Wellbeing are increasingly making easier (thanks Tristan Harris!), its's possible to derive net positive value.

Towards the end of the book, it seemed like he was kinda repeating himself. I would've liked him to more clearly express that deep work was not just throwing yourself into hustle culture / eliminating things, but that it in itself is rather enjoyable (making the craftsman analogy a little more clear).

## Conclusion

Some really nice insights. I had felt a decent amount of this sentiment already, but Newport provides some methods for quantification and reduction of shallow work. If you like this content, and would like to see more of it, ironically don't follow Newport's advice, and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suchcaptcha). I'm also working on an app to help you improve your productivty, [banh](https://banh.app), which I'd appreciate you signing up for.
