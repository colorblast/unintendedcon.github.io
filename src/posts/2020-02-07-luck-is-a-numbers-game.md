  - You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. You already know this probably, so here's dealing with rejectionism.

I was watching Iliza Schlesinger's Netflix special Elder Millenial and she was talking about how when guys talk about how they got married, they say that they were in a bar and were hanging out with their buddies, when some girl catches their eye and they instantly know she's the one. Iliza then segues into the extremely funny mechanics for how this overly simplistic narrative actually happens: the girl has to dress up, scope out everybody, then specifically be in the exact spot to catch that guy's eye.

I believe that the world works in a similar way. This clashes with much of the reductionism that occurs in the self-help and business industry, where you see titles like 'Lose 15 pounds in a week!'. Luck is an intersection of "being there at the right time", "being the right person", and "existing". It often gets reductionized to the first point.

Luck does involve being there at the right time. A person who was born in the 19th century can know as much as she desires about cryptocurrency, but there is no way she can get in on the bitcoin craze. Some people are behind on their time; some people are ahead of their time. Luck requires that people can see and understand whatever it is that you want to do / are doing.

Luck also involves being the right person. In CS and machine learning for example, the job market is very good. Candidate pools are not oversaturated and companies are, for the most part, looking to hire whoever they can get. These opportunies exist. Right now. Yet, if you don't have the necessary skills, whether it is knowledge of data structures or abstract design patterns, you can't reach out to these opportunities. If you find that you are in a situation where your current level of opportunities are low, you should consider whether you are happy with your situation and whether it might be best to work towards learning skills in high opportunity markets.

And lastly, luck also involves existing, e.g., applying to things and making your presence felt. You should find that given a demand supply relationship that more coveted fields, opportunities, and jobs have higher rejection rates. This is completely normal and should be understood as a numbers game. Applying to things can be very tiring, especially for people who like to narrow-focus on certain things, and I really don't have of an answer for how to fix that (if you're in CS, check out aline lerner's [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io)). I've found that the world is increasingly a rather small bubble, particularly given the breadth of the Internet, and the decreased socioeconomic ladder (smaller amount of people centralized at the top), so you should take care towards not letting a rejection (if well-handled) completely change your perception of something or a person. Vent if you must, but forgiveness (of everyone) is a good virtue.

You can apply this to all parts of your life. It is highly probable that if you have a decent enough value-add proposition, that a person, regardless of their socioeconomic status or fame, will respond (even cold-emailing). Whenever you want something, doing research and finding an appropriate value add proposition for the other person can help increase the odds that you get what you want. This doesn't have to be super complicated; you see it in marketing blogs all the time. If you want someone to cover your shift at work, you offer them something, whether its covering his shift at a later time, compensation, or an IOU. If you approach everything in a similar manner, it should enable you to not only better reach your goals, but help other people reach theirs.
