New York has been [due for an earthquake](https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2018/04/01/new-york-city-is-due-for-magnitude-5-or-stronger-earthquake) since it hasn't hasn't had one in 136 years. I wouldn't be surprised if it happened this year.

The west coast is engulfed in flames while two storms are battering the southeast.

One of the strongest lines of Leonard Cohen's *Everybody Knows* is '... everybody knows that the plague is coming'. We had advance warning when we saw China engaging in full lockdowns. It took about a month for the disease to leak onto our soil.

We knew that it was moving fast, and yet all our institutions either did nothing or suppressed concerns. Vox was most egregious in doing this.

Now that we've entered the [clusterfuck](https://www.dailytarheel.com/article/2020/08/covid-clusters-edit-0816) of healthcare breakdown, job loss, economic downfall, environmental degradation, race relations, and business looting, the future looks as bleak as ever. 

This is the age of disenchantment.  

America seems to know something is wrong. Our public opinion polls of our government, our media, and our politicians are at all-time lows.

And yet nothing seems to change. We seem to be motivated by loss aversion (return to the status quo!) rather than trying to address why our system was so brittle in the first place.

And as our system continues to fail, people will look to opt out of it.

Conspiracies like QAnon are flourishing because of neglect. When the system seems to be perversely weighed against you, it starts to look more cult-ish.

[A quarter of young adults in this country have contemplated suicide](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2020/why-people-dont-trust-contact-tracers-and-why-that-matters/) in this past month. In a country that doesn't even pretend to try to care about you, when the economic incentives are even arraigned against doing so, the opt out seems to be to end it all.

[Drug dependency and anxiety have skyrocketed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/anti-anxiety-medication-prescriptions-have-spiked-34-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-04-16).

We are motivated by safetyism. As chaos continues to drudge on, there will be growing support for authoritarianism. It may not be this year. It may not be in the next 8 years. But the seed's been planted and if the country doesn't reverse course, there won't be anything left fighting for.

The [fall of the Weimar Republic](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp34srd/revision/1) has many of the same characteristics that exist now. High unemployment, an ineffective government, rise of extremism, and a reduction  in manufacturing.

Actual policy has been replaced by performance.

The growth we've seen in the past decade has been fueled by the other: war (who cares how many people we kill or how effective it is, since war is a subscription business), prison (who cares how many 'other' people we imprison if it makes people feel safer and makes money), and student debt (who cares if we mortgage the future of others).

They may have high gross margins, but they also have real side effects.

A world without war is something that everybody would probably agree is good. Less people dead, more money to spend on other things.

But unfortunately, this is not the case. And since every company wants to be in the subscription business, the incumbent companies who make money from war never want war to end.
